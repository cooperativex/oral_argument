  "background": "In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which requires private insurers to cover certain preventive-care services without cost sharing. Rather than defining these services directly, the ACA empowers three agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services to determine required services: the United States Preventive Services Task Force (Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The Task Force consists of sixteen volunteer experts serving four-year terms, ACIP has fifteen members selected by the HHS Secretary, and HRSA operates through offices and bureaus reporting to the HHS Secretary. Over the years, these agencies issued various preventive care recommendations, including ACIP’s 2007 recommendation for HPV vaccines, HRSA’s 2011 guidelines for contraceptive coverage, and the Task Force’s 2019 recommendation for HIV prevention drugs (PrEP). Four individuals and two Christian-based businesses in Texas challenged these requirements, arguing that mandatory coverage of these services violated their religious beliefs by making them “complicit in facilitating homosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage between one man and one woman.” The plaintiffs filed suit in 2020 against the federal government and various department secretaries, primarily arguing that the structure of these agencies violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. The district court ruled in their favor regarding the Task Force but rejected their challenges to ACIP and HRSA, and both parties appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the Task Force’s structure violated the Appointments Clause and upheld the injunction against enforcing its recommendations, but reversed the district court’s universal remedies and remanded for further consideration of whether HHS properly ratified ACIP and HRSA’s recommendations.",

      "target_dialogue": "## Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe will hear argument first this morning in Case 24-316, Kennedy\nversus Braidwood Management.\nMr. Mooppan.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Task Force members are\ninferior officers because they are subject to ample supervision by the\nSecretary in issuing recommendations that bind the public.\nMost importantly, the Secretary can remove Task Force members at will.\nHis power to remove them flows from his power to appoint them acting\nthrough the director's authorities.\nAnd this Court has repeatedly recognized that at-will removal power is a\npowerful tool for control.\nMoreover, the Secretary can review Task Force recommendations and\nprevent them from taking effect.\nDuring the minimum interval period, he can direct the Task Force to\nrescind a recommendation, and he can replace Task Force members as\nneeded to ensure that happens.\nIn addition, he can require the Task Force to obtain his pre -approval\nbefore they issue any recommendation at all.\nGiven these collective powers of supervision, the Task Force cannot\nissue final recommendations that bind the public unless the Secretary\npermits them to do so.\nRespondents' contrary argument rests entirely on the statutory\nlanguage providing that the T ask Force shall be independent and, to the\nextent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\nBut, as this Court's cases make clear, that language does not create a\nrestriction on removing the Task Force members, and it does not impose\na bar on reviewing their recommendations.\nIt certainly does not do so clearly enough to overcome the canon of\nconstitutional avoidance, especially since the language itself\ncontemplates some amount of political involvement.\nIn all events, if that statutory language is the constitutional problem,\nthen the solution is straightforward.\nThis Court should hold that the language is unenforceable and\nseverable.\nIt is neither necessary nor appropriate to hold instead that Task Force\nmembers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the\nSenate.\nI welcome this Court's questions.",

      "target_dialogue": "## Justice Thomas\n### Justice Thomas:\nBefore we get to the constitutional problems, what's the statutory\nauthority to appoint the Task Force?\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo there are two sources of authority, Your Honor.\nThe first is that under the Reorganization Act, the Secretary has the\npower to exercise all functions and duties of the director, and the\ndirector, under 299, has the authority to convene the Task Force.\n### Justice Thomas:\nIsn't that an odd delegation? Normally, it would be the superior or the\nprincipal officer who would have the authority who would delegate it to\nsubordinates.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nWell, it's not just a delegation, Your Honor.\nThe Reorganization Act was in place when 299 was enacted.\nAnd so, when Congress passed 299 and said that the director could\nconvene the Task Force, that meant that the Secretary could convene\nthe Task Force.\n### Justice Thomas:\nSo what --so the word --you're using the word \"convene?\"\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nYes, Your Honor.\n### Justice Thomas:\nWell, I think that normally connotes just calling a meeting or\nsomething.\nThe court was convened this morning.\nThe Chief didn't appoint any of us.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo I agree, Your Honor, that \"convene\" doesn't necessarily connote\nappointment, but there's no other language in the statute that specifies\nwho will appoint these members, and in that -- in light of that,\n\"convene\" is most naturally read to mean convene and select the\npeople who will serve on -- on the board.\nAnd that's clearly true before nine -- before the ACA.\nBefore the ACA was enacted, it's clear that the Secretary and the\ndirector had the power to convene these -- to appoint these individuals.\n### Justice Thomas:\nBut appointment would not be an issue if they had no authority to\nrequire anything of --of others.\nIt's just advisory.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nWell, not as a constitutional matter but as a statutory matter, and I took\nyour question to be, where is the statutory authority to do this? Before\nthe ACA, it had to be the case that the Secretary or the director had the\nauthority.\nIt would not be constitutional for the president to select and the Senate\nto confirm these individuals before the ACA because, before the ACA,\neveryone agrees they weren't officers.\nAnd the Senate has no constitutional power to have any role in the\nselection of a non-officer. So the only way to construe the statute\nbefore the ACA is that the Secretary and the director had the ability, and\nnothing about the ACA changed that.\n### Justice Thomas:\nCan you give me an example of another body that's selected this way\njust with using the operative term \"convene\" and that had been and\nthat the authority comes from --through a subordinate to the\nprincipal?\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo not off the top of my head, Your Honor, but, again, the -- as a\n### Justice Thomas:\nYeah.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nanywhere in the code that says who will pick these people.\nSo the most natural way of reading a provision that says he shall\nconvene the Task Force is to also select the people who will serve on the\nTask Force.",

Mooppan:\nI don't think so, Your Honor.\nLet me give you the most straightforward of them.\nUnder the statute itself, no recommendation takes effect until the\nSecretary sets the minimum interval period.\n### Justice Alito:\nRight, right.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nAnd the minimum interval period is at least one year.\n### Justice Alito:\nYeah.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo one year is more than adequate time for the Secretary, if he doesn't\nagree with the recommendation, to direct the board to rescind it, the\nforce to rescind it and, if the Task Force doesn't rescind it, to replace\nthem with people who will.\nThat doesn't seem very jerry-built to me. In addition to that, the\nSecretary also has the power to create a pre-approval requirement.\nUnder 300gg-92, he has rulemaking power to implement the statute,\nand he can say: Before you issue any recommendations, submit it to me\nfor my approval, and if and only if I approve it can you issue it in the first\nplace.\n### Justice Alito:\nAnd if -- if -- if Congress really wanted these Task Force members to do\nthe bidding of the Secretary, isn't that an incredibly odd way to go about\nconferring that authority?\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nNo, because, critically, we are not saying that Congress wanted the Task\nForce to do the Secretary's bidding.\nWe agree that the Task -- the Secretary cannot tell the Task Force to\nmake a given recommendation.\nIf the Task Force doesn't want to make a recommendation, it doesn't\nhave to make a recommendation.\nOur point is simply that if the Task Force does make a recommendation,\nthe Secretary can block it.\nIt's --to use an analogy, it's like bicameralism.\nThe Senate can't force the House to pass a bill.\nBut, if the Senate doesn't also agree with the bill, it doesn't become a\nlaw.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, under the argument that you just made, why can't the Secretary\ndemand that a particular recommendation be made using exactly the\nsame author ity that you just outlined? What am I missing? The\npresident says: I want you to make this recommendation, and if you\ndon't make this recommendation, I'm going to remove you and replace\nyou with somebody who will make the recommendation.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo he can remove them, but we don't think he has the ability to force\nthe phrase \"independence\" and, more importantly, the phrase \"the\nrecommendations made shall be independent\" in 299b-4(a)(6), we do\nthink that that language does prevent that.\nAnd that makes perfect sense.\nIf you take a step back and think about the statutory scheme, Congress\nwas, as it often does, balancing competing objectives.\nOn the one hand, it wanted the benefits of an expert body. It wanted\nrecommendations that reflected their best scientific judgment.\nBut, on the other hand, it recognized that you need to have political\naccountability.\nAnd so the Secretary can block it, but -- and that solves the problem.\nIt means that no final decision could be made that binds the public\nunless the Secretary approves it.",

Mooppan:\nWell, it is an entity that is convened by the Public Health Service,\nselected by the Public Health Service, supervised by the Public Health\n### Justice Thomas:\nNow is it structurally --is it -- is it structurally or statutorily designated\na part of an agency?\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nAgain, I -- there's not anything that says they are or aren't, but I think\nthe clear best reading of the statute is, when you have an entity that's\nconvened by the Public Health Service, selected by the Public Health\nService, supervised by the Public Health Service, and supported by the\nPublic Health Service, it's part of the Public Health Ser vice.",

I could say: I want you to make an independent judgment and I\nwant it to be free of political influence or free of outside influence.\nAnd by that, I would mean outside the Court, I might mean outside of\nour chambers, but I might not mean for it to be apart from me, not\nindependent of me.\nAnd I could even do that ex ante.\nyour --your best take on its interpretation, seen through the lens of,\nyou know, the way I interpret statutes, the way I see law.\nSo not entirely independent.\nIf you see statutes --I mean, so, you know, I -- I don't put a huge\namount of stock in legislative history.\nSo, if I say: You know, give me your best reading of the statute and that's\nwhat they bring back, that's not going to be very useful to me.\nSo they're not independent of me or my instruction even though I could\nsay they were independent in a very real sense of the word. But I take it\nthat you don't adopt that view?\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo, Your Honor, we could have taken an even narrower interpretation of\n\"independence\" along the lines you're suggesting.\nWe thought the better reading of the statute in light of its context is the\none we have articulated, where there is independence in the\nrecommendation made even vis-- vis the Secretary.\n### Justice Barrett:\nEven vis-- vis the Secretary.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nBut it doesn't block the Secretary on the back end.\nOf course, if you want to interpret the statute even more narrowly than\nthat, then that just makes it even harder for Mr. Mitchell.\n### Justice Barrett:\nWell, I mean, I think the fact that you could interpret it and, I think, give\ncontent to the word \"independence\" in an even narrower sense, I mean,\nyou have a more middle of the road, and then, as I said, I think Mr.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nRight.\n### Justice Barrett:\nnecessary.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nI -- I think that's right, Your Honor.\nAnd, again, ultimately, I think one way of thinking about this is this is an\nAppointments Clause challenge, so the question is whether there is\nadequate supervision.\nThe Court doesn't necessarily need to get into the exact level of what\n\"independent\" means and does it mean what you said or what I said.\nAll we -- the Court really needs to say is there's enough supervision that\nthese are properly understood as inferior officers.\nThat's all you need to do to reject the claim here and reverse the\ndecision below.\n### Justice Barrett:\nThank you.",

Mooppan:\nSure.\nAnd, you know, we do think we have the better reading.\nBut, if you thought there was ambiguity here about what the scope of\n\"independence\" was or whether the appointment power was vested in\nthe Secretary rather than just the director, this Court obviously reads\nstatutes to avoid constitutional problems rather than create them.\nSo you shouldn't read the phrase \"independent\" to impose a removal\nrestriction that's not there, to impose a bar on review that's not there,\nto impose restrictions on who can appoint that aren't there.\nYou should read the statute to reinforce that the Secretary has adequate\nsupervision so that the statute, as written by Congress, can continue to\noperate.\nAnd Mr. Mitchell's only real response to all of that is, again, to say, well,\nthe statute's actually perfectly constitutional on even his theory\nbecause he thinks the president can appoint and the Senate can\nconfirm.\nBut that doesn't work as a statutory matter for the reasons we\ndiscussed.\nAnd once you take that off the table, his reading does create serious\nconstitutional problems with the statute that you can void if you adopt\nour reading.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThank you.",

Mitchell:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals\ncorrectly held that Task Force members are principal officers who must\nbe appointed by the president and the Senate, as required by Article II.\nThey cannot be inferior officers because their task -- because their\npreventive care coverage mandates are neither directed nor supervised\nby the Secretary of Health and Human Services or by anyone else who\nhas been appointed as a principal officer.\nThe governing statutes make this clear.\nSection 300gg-13(a)(1) gives the Task Force alone the prerogative to\nimpose preventive care coverage mandates on insurers regardless of\nwhether the Secretary approves or disapproves a Task Force\nrecommendation.\nAnd Section 299b -4(a)(1) and (a)(6) require the Task Force members\nand their recommendations be kept independent and, to the extent\npracticable, protected from any type of political pressure.\nThese statutes cannot co-exist with a regime in which the Secretary can\noverrule the Task Force coverage recommendations or deny them\nbinding effect.\nThe Court also has no authority to sever Section 299b-4(a)(6), as\nproposed by the government.\nThe remedy prescribed by this Court must take the form of a final\njudgment to be entered by the district court on remand.\nAnd a federal district court has no authority and no ability to formally\nrevoke or cancel a statutory provision when entering judgment for a\nparty.\nMore importantly, a remedy from this Court must, to the maximum\npossible extent, respect the will of Congress as reflected in its enacted\nlaws.\nCongress has chosen to create an independent Task Force and shield it\nfrom political pressure, and the plaintiffs' proposed remedy honors that\ncongressional decision.\nThe government's proposed remedy would rewrite the statute into\nsomething unrecognizable by the Congress that enacted the ACA.\nAnd it is not even clear that Congress would have approved a regime in\nwhich politicians, rather than an independent Task Force, decide the\npreventive care that insurers must cover.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Mitchell:\nWell, there are two different words in play here.\nIt's not just the word \"independent,\" which appears in both Section\n299b-4(a)(1) and (a)(6).\nIt's also the phrase in subsection (a)(6) that says the Task Force is to be\nprotected from political pressure to the extent practicable.\nAnd we don't see any way that statutory language can be squared with\nthe regime envisioned by the government, where the Secretary can\ncome in and influence the Task Force decisions on the front end, which\nMooppan once again acknowledged at oral argument he believes the\nSecretary can do that. And we don't see how that can be squared with\nthe actual statutory language.\nMr. Mooppan suggests invoking the canon of constitutional avoidance\nin a way to bend subsection (a)(6) to make it more accommodating of\nhis view of secretarial power. But the constitutional avoidance canon is\ninapplicable here for many reasons.\nNumber one, Mr. Mooppan's proposed reading of subsection (a)(6) does\nnot avoid any of the constitutional problems that occurred.\nUnder the government's interpretation of subsection (a)(6), the Task\nForce members are still principal officers because they have\nunreviewable discretion when deciding not to recommend A or B ratings\non a particular preventive care service or when they decide to withdraw\na previous A or B rating that they have conferred prior to their decision\nto withdraw.\nThat means they have final decisionmaking authority that's not subject\nto direction and supervision.",

Mitchell:\nSo the test for principal officer status is whether the officer in question\nis directed and supervised in his decisionmaking.\nOn the government's reading of Section 299b-4(a)(6), if the Court\nwere to adopt that view, the Secretary would have the ability to overrule\nTask Force decisions to confer A or B ratings on preventive care.\nBut the Secretary would not have any authority to overrule the Task\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut why is that?\n### Jonathan F.

Mitchell:\nBut they also have all their decisions subject to review by a principal\nofficer.\nWhat this Court said in Edmond was that the reason those judges were\ndeemed inferior was because they could not issue any final decision on\nbehalf of the United States without being allowed to do so by a principal\nofficer.",

Mitchell:\nYes.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWhat are your thoughts?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nThe difference in Free Enterprise Fund was the SEC had all sorts of\nsupervisory authority over the PCAOB, the Public Accounting -- the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board that is not present here.\nThe SEC could review and alter any rulemaking done by the board.\nThe SEC could review and overrule any sanction that was being imposed\nby the board.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nBut what about a non-action by the board?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nWell, if you look at page 504 of the Court's opinion in Free Enterprise\nFund, it lists all the ways in which the SEC had these oversight\nauthorities.\nAnd this is not -- with all respect, Your Honor, this is not a situation of\nnon -action.\nWhen the Task Force decides to issue a C, D, or I rating rather than an A or\nB rating, that is action. It's not inaction.\nIf the Task Force decides to withdraw an A or B rating that it previously\nconferred, that is also action rather than inaction.\nSo the government's brief tries to rely on the act/omission distinction.\nIt just doesn't hold up here.\nThere will be situations in which the Task Force can take affirmative\nactions that cause a certain type of preventive care not to receive the A\nor B rating.\nAnd the government concedes that's unreviewable, so that means\nthey're still principal officers.\nBut there's a second problem as well. Even if this Court were to think\nthat Task Force members become inferior officers under the\ngovernment's interpretation of the statute, they are still\nunconstitutionally appointed because Congress has not vested the\nSecretary of Health and Human Service with the authority to appoint\nthe Task Force.\nAnd the court of appeals did not reach this question, as\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nnoted during the questioning of Mr. Mooppan.\nBut the Court would have to conclude that there was vesting of this\nauthority in the Secretary before it can say that they're constitutionally\nappointed now.",

Mitchell:\nRight.\nBut the problem here, it's not really a question of removal power, Justice\nKagan.\nThe test for principal officer status turns on whether the Secretary can\ndirect and supervise the decisions of these Task Force members.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nRight.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Kagan:\nsomebody said it's not the end all and the be all.\nI think Mr. Mooppan said that.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nRight.\n### Justice Kagan:\nAnd I don't know.\nIf you read this Court's decisions, it seems often to be the end all and the\nbe all, that the Court has suggested on many occasions that removal\npower is really the essence of control.\nIf you have it, you have control.\nIf you don't have it, you don't have control.\nNow, as you know I'm sure, on -- on a number of occasions, I've said\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nRight.\n### Justice Kagan:\nBut the Court has said it again and again.\nSo why doesn't it get you, if not a hundred percent of the way there in a\ncontext like this, pretty near there?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nI think that argument would have more force if it weren't for the opinion\nin Arthrex.\nIf we were litigating this case 10 years ago before the Arthrex opinion, I\nthink that would have a lot of -- that would be a very powerful reason to\nsay these could be inferior officers.\nBut, if you look at the Arthrex opinion, pages 15 and 16, where Arthrex\ncatalogs all the ways in which the PTO Director can influence the\ndecisionmaking of these administrative patent judges in an informal\nway, without the formal ability to review their decisions, and then the\nCourt says not only is that not good enough, it actually says that\naggravates the problem.\nThis is not the solution; it is the problem because it blurs the lines of\naccountability and it undermines the transparency that the\nAppointments Clause is supposed to provide.\nYou know, again, if Arthrex wasn't there, I think we would have an\ninteresting discussion about whether the test for principal officer status\nshould be this formalistic test that Arthrex sets forth or whether we\nshould have more of a hard-nosed legal realist look at the actual powers\nthat the Secretary can exert to influence the Task Force.\nBut Arthrex really, I think, makes it hard for that argument to get off the\nground.",

Mitchell:\nYes.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBecause we don't just have potential at -will removal power here. We\nhave something in this statute that seems to me to be fairly unusual,\nwhich is the requirement that the Secretary establish this minimal\ninterval after the recommendation is made before they come -- it\ncomes into effect.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nRight.\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo can you speak to why that doesn't have some indicia of secretarial\ncontrol that we can look to when we try to understand the relationship\nbetween the Secretary and these members and their\nrecommendations?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nI think it has the opposite implication,\n### Justice Jackson:\n, because 300gg-\n13 specifically addresses the Secretary's role vis-- vis the Task Force,\nand as Justice Kavanaugh suggested earlier, it only allows the Secretary\nto determine when these preventive care provisions are to take effect.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI mean, if you're right that these are principal officers who are making\nbinding recommendations, I guess I'm struggling to understand what\nthe point of deferring them or allowing the Secretary to intervene and\ndefer them for at least a year, what is -- what is the point of that?\n### Jonathan F.

Mitchell:\nRight.\n### Justice Jackson:\nMr. Mooppan says, during that interval, the Secretary can not only delay\nthe recommendations but can also, in his view, take some steps as to\nthe constitution of the Task Force, perhaps even in communication with\nthem regarding those steps having been done because they made\ncertain recommendations with --with respect to which the Secretary\ndisagrees.\nSo I guess I'm just trying -- I mean, it doesn't necessarily suggest that\nreally this is only a time -related thing.\nThe Secretary's getting involved.\nHe's making decisions.\nWhy doesn't that give us some basis for interpreting this to be a statute\nin which there is secretarial control?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nWe dispute all those claims Mr. Mooppan made about what the\nSecretary can do during that minimum time interval because the\nstatutes guarantee the Task Force's independence.\nWhat Mr. Mooppan is describing where the Secretary can put pressure\non the Task Force to pull down a previously issued A or B rating is not\nconsistent with the statutory guarantee.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut the statute doesn't have specific blocks, and so what I'm -- what I\nguess I'm -- I'm going back to this notion of how should we be reading\nthis statute.\nYou dispute that the Secretary can do all of those things, but the statute\ndoesn't say he can't.\nAnd so why would we read the statute to prevent the Secretary from\nexercising the control that is necessary to make it constitutional in this\nsituation?\n### Jonathan F.

Mitchell:\nAny kind of pressure,\n### Justice Alito:\n, is incompatible in our view with the\nstatutory guarantees of independence.\nI don't see how that distinction can be reconciled with the text of a\nstatute that not only guarantees the independence of the Task Force\nmembers and their recommendations but also says that the Task Force\nand their recommendations has to be immunized from political\npressure to the extent practicable.\nI just don't see how that distinction could be squared with anything in\nthe text of the statute.\nI think what Mr. Mooppan is trying to do is salvage some role for 299b-\n4(a)(6) because it's not plausible, I think, even on the government's\nview to allow the earlier enacted statutes, such as Section 202 and the\nReorganization Plan, to completely swallow up these later-enacted\nguarantees of independence. So they're trying to draw some line. But\nthere's nothing in the text of the statute that can provide an anchor for\nthe distinction he --that he's trying to draw.\nSuppose it were ultimately -- suppose it is ultimately decided that the\nstatute implicitly confers the appointment power on the Secretary and\nthat -- and then how much more of the statute would have to be\njettisoned in order to make it constitutional?\n### Justice Alito:\nLike the setup constitutional?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nYeah.\nNone of the statute needs to be jettisoned in order to make it\nconstitutional even under our reading of the statute.\nIf the Court decides that Congress has vested the Secretary with\nappointment power over the Task Force, the appointments are still\nunconstitutional in our view because they're principal officers.\nThey have to be appointed by the president and the Senate no matter\nwhat.\nBut, if the Court even rejects that view, there's still the problem that the\nTask Force was appointed by the AHRQ director for 13 years between\n2010 in March and June of 2023, and there has to be some remedy\nissued for those admitted constitutional violations.\n### Justice Alito:\nSo that would be -- that would be for the -- what was done before\nSecretary Becerra.\nWhat about going forward? What would need to be done?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nGoing forward, it will depend on whether the Court thinks these are\nprincipal officers.\nIf the Court thinks they're principal officers, then they have to be\nappointed by the president and the Senate as well.\n### Justice Alito:\nSuppose we thought that they were inferior officers.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nIf the Court thinks they're inferior officers, there should be a remand, in\nour view, to the Fifth Circuit to rule on the question whether Congress\nhas vested the Secretary of Health and Human Services with\nappointment power.\nI don't think it's appropriate for the Court to decide that issue based on\nhow cursory the briefing is.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, suppose that -- suppose we do that, the Fifth Circuit goes back\nand says that, or we tackle the question and we say that the statute\nvests -- vests the appointment power in the Secretary.\nThen what?\n### Justice Alito:\nAnd what -- that's what I'm asking.\nWhat would the remedy be?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nThe remedy would have to be an injunction that restrains the Secretary\nfrom enforcing any of the Task Force coverage recommendations that\nissued between March of 2010 and June of 2023.\nEven the government concedes the Task Force was unconstitutionally\nappointed during that time.\nSo I don't see how the government can deny that we're entitled to at\nleast that much.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nIf the Court -- the remedy going forward if the Court concludes that\nthey're inferior officers and that the Secretary's been vested with\nappointment power, there should be no remedy going forward.\nWe only can get a remedy for those past --that 13-year window.\n### Justice Alito:\nOkay.\nThank you.",

And, you know, just an alternative view of\nthat language is something along the lines of: Look, the members of this\nTask Force are going to be subject to some kinds of influence because\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nMm-hmm.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Kagan:\nBut we want them to approach their jobs with a spirit of independent-\nness.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nRight.\n### Justice Kagan:\nAnd -- and also, Congress is saying to the people who -- you know, who\nshould think about the fact that this system works best if the Task Force\nmembers are treated as independent, but it's -- it's hortatory.\nIt's not saying that nobody can fire them.\nIt's not saying that nobody can supervise them and nobody can, you\nknow, prevent their recommendations from going forward.\nIt's hortatory.\nSo why shouldn't I read the statute that way?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nWell, even if Your Honor read s the statute that way, they're still\nprincipal officers under Arthrex because, under that view that Your\nHonor is describing of \"independence,\" there's no authority in the\nSecretary to formally review and formally reverse the decisions the Task\nForce is making in either direction.\nAnd that's what Arthrex says is key. There may be informal ways the\nSecretary can influence the Task Force, such as removal or threatened\nremoval or other types of tactics, but Arthrex discusses all these types of\nand it says that's not good enough.\n### Justice Kagan:\nOkay.\nSo then I'm going to say then it --then your argument depends on a\n### Justice Kagan:\nWe're not dealing with every circumstance, every scenario.\nYou know, we're dealing here with a particular kind of officer.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nI just --I don't think that's an aggressive reading at all because Arthrex\nsays the touchstone for principal officer status is whether there is\nformal review available of the relevant official's decisionmaking.\nAnd even under the government's construction of the statutes, the only\nformal review that they're providing is formal review of an affirmative\ndecision by the Task Force to issue an A or B rating.\nThey admit that the Secretary can't reverse the Task Force if it makes a\ndecision in the opposite direction, a decision not to impose an A or B\nrating.\nI mean, that alone is enough to make them principal officers even under\nthe SG's view and even under Your Honor's proposed interpretation of\nthe word \"independent.\" At the end of the day, when you go back to\nSection 300gg-13(a)(1), it is the Task Force recommendation that\nmatters.\nThat is what is binding on insurers.\nIt is not the Secretary's decision that can bind insurers. So, even if the\nSecretary were to say: I hereby disapprove this Task Force\nrecommendation, that's useless when it comes to Section 300gg-13(a)\n(1) because what matters is what the Task Force says.\nIt's not what the Secretary says.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.",

Mitchell:\nRight.\nI mean, it's not within the scope of the question presented.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nRight.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nSo what do we do about it?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nWell, I'm happy to answer Your Honor's question, but, again, it's not\nproperly before this Court because it's not in the scope of the QP.\nThe government did not seek certiorari on the question.\nAnd at no point anywhere in the briefing or in Mr. Mooppan's oral\npresentation today has the government asked this Court to reverse that\npart of the Fifth Circuit's ruling.\nBut the ruling is nonetheless correct because the only entity that has\nthe power to impose preventive care coverage mandates is the Task\nForce.\nThe Secretary's role is only to determine when those coverage\nmandates take effect.\nSo for the Secretary to go out and say: I hereby ratify the Task Force\nrecommendations, that has no more legal force than if I were to produce\na memo that says I ratify the Task Force recommendations.\nI don't have any authority to impose preventive care coverage mandates\neither. Neither does the Secretary.\nSo the document has no force --that's what the Fifth Circuit said in its\nopinion, and that's completely right.\nThe other reason is notice an d comment.\nThe Fifth Circuit did not reach that issue.\nBut this is undoubtedly a substantive rule.\nIt's clearly a rule.\nAnd it's a substantive rule as well because it's imposing binding legal\nobligations on private insurers. It's prescribing law and policy.\nSo it has to go through notice and comment unless some exception\napplies.\nMaybe the good cause exception if the government wants to argue for\nthat.\nBut, again, they 've waived this entire issue, so I don't think they can\npossibly make that type of argument now about how an exception to\nnotice and comment might kick in.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nThank you.",

Mooppan:\nSo I'll pick up right there.\nSo, on the question of whether the Secretary has the power to review,\ngg-13 just says that recommendations that are in effect are binding.\nIt doesn't say one word about whether the Secretary could prevent the\nrecommendation from taking effect by directing the Task Force to\nwithdraw it.\nHis only argument on that is to rely on the language \"independent,\"\ninterpreting \"independent\" way more broadly than necessary, and\ncreating constitutional problems rather than solving it.\nHe recognizes that, and so he falls back on the point that even we agree\nthat the Secretary can't force the Task Force to make recommendations.\nBut, as Justice Gorsuch pointed out, that was already decided in Free\nEnterprise Fund.\nthe Commission had lots of power over the PCAOB, which is true, but, if\nyou look at page 504 of Free Enterprise Fund, this is what the Court said:\nThe Act nowhere gives the Commission effective power to start, stop, or\nalter individual board investigations.\nThat is exactly the argument he's making here, that because they didn't\nhave that power in this case, they are principal officers. And Free\nEnterprise Fund says, even though they didn't have that power, they\nwere inferior officers.\nTurning to the removal question, I didn't really hear any argument for\nwhy, as a statutory matter, you should read \"independent\" to create a\nremoval restriction even though that creates lots of constitutional\nproblems.\nThe best he did was to suggest, well, maybe it's just a question of\ntiming.\nBut, actually, the timing cuts against him too. b --b-4(a)(6), the\nprovision that has the \"independence\" language, it was added to the\nstatute with the ACA at the time that Congress gave the Task Force\nthese powers.\nThat's when they added the language about \"independent\" and \"free\nfrom political pressure to the maximum extent possible.\" So, if they\nwanted to impose a removal restriction, they would have done it using\nall the language that",

They had cause protection.\nSo Arthrex doesn't solve it for him either.\nTurning to the appointments question, I agree that it wasn't decided\nbelow and it could be remanded, but I think the colloquy here today\nmakes clear why the answer is quite clear and why it would be better to\njust resolve it now.\nMy friend says that the statute is agnostic about who can appoint.\nI believe he even said that the Secretary of Energy or a private party\ncould appoint these people.\nThat is obviously wrong on its face. Among other things, it doesn't\nanswer what happens if three different people all purport to appoint the\nsame -- appoint different people to the Task Force.\nYou cannot possibly read this statute to say it's agnostic about who\npicks the members of the Task Force.\nAnd given that someone has to pick them, the word \"convened\" must\nsuggest that the person doing the convening is the one who's doing the\npicking.\nSo then now all we have left is, is it the director or is it the Secretary?

And that's exactly what this\nstatute does two different ways.\nAnd if there was any doubt about this, Hartwell --this is an easier case\nfor us than Hartwell.\nIn Hartwell, as you pointed out, there was an inferior officer who had the\nability to make the appointment with the Secretary's approval on the\nback end.\nBut the decision in the first instance was vested in someone who wasn't\nthe head of the department. And yet the Court still said that that was\nenough to satisfy the Appointments Clause.\nHere, the Secretary can and, in fact, has exercised the appointment\nauthority in the first instance.\nSo, if Hartwell is okay, this is a fortiori from that.\nSo, for all those reasons, there's just no real good reason to remand this\nto the Fifth Circuit on this appointments question. There is no way you\ncan read this statute to vest the appointment in anyone other than the\ndirector/Secretary, and the Secretary has complete control in that\nsituation.\nA final point on remedy, we agree with Mr. Mitchell on this: If we are\nright that these are inferior officers, prospectively, he's not entitled to\nany remedy, and retrospectively, there will need to be a remand to figure\nout whether the old recommendations either have to be enjoined or can\nbe ratified by the Task Force.\nThank you.",
