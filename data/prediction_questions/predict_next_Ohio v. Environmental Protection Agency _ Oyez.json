  "background": "Under the Clean Air Act’s “good neighbor” provision, aimed at addressing transboundary ozone pollution that can exacerbate health issues like asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in October 2015 set new air-quality standards for ozone pollution. This provision necessitates that “upwind” states mitigate emissions that could affect air quality in “downwind” states. Following this, states were required to submit plans indicating how they would meet these standards and reduce emissions impacting other states. However, the EPA rejected the plans from 21 states for proposing no changes and additionally addressed two states that had failed to submit plans. In response, it published a federal plan mandating power plants and other industrial facilities in these 23 states to implement existing controls more effectively from 2023 and adopt commonly used controls by 2026, along with requiring controls for other ozone pollution sources like cement kilns and industrial boilers. The plan also utilized an existing emissions trading program among the affected states. This federal intervention sparked a legal challenge from three states, several companies, and trade associations, requesting a court to temporarily block the EPA rule. They labeled the federal rule a “disaster” that could lead to electric-grid emergencies, an assertion countered by the EPA and its supporters, who deemed such claims speculative. These supporters argued that delaying the rule’s enforcement would critically impede efforts in environmental protection and public health. Consequently, a dozen states initiated a lawsuit against the EPA’s rejection of their emission plans, highlighting the ongoing dispute over federal and state responsibilities in air quality management under the Clean Air Act’s provisions.",

Sridharan:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The EPA set out to address\nthe contributions of 23 upwind states to downwind air pollution\nthrough a single federal plan, but, as commenters predicted and before\nthe plan became final, the legal predicates for the federal plan, that is,\nthe state plan disapprovals, came under fire in courts all around the\ncountry. The specter of lesser participation in the federal plan revealed\nyet another problem. The EPA's choice of method, that is, selecting a\nsingle cost threshold and applying it uniformly across all 23 states to\nestablish emissions limits, has consequences; namely, the math doesn't\nwork when the inputs don't match the outputs. With the SIP\ndisapprovals in flux and the EPA's methodology requiring full\nparticipation, the EPA had an obligation to consider what happens to the\nfederal plan when one or more states drop out, that is, when the inputs,\n23 states, don't match the outputs, now the 11 states that remain in the\nplan. Its failure has become consequential. The plan now regulates\nunder half of the states and a quarter of the emissions that the EPA\noriginally set out to regulate. Under this fractured plan and without a\nstay, the remaining states and their industries face serious harm. I\nwelcome the Court's questions.",

Sridharan:\nThe best evidence for that, Your Honor, is the method that the EPA\nchose, and the method it chose has to do with discerning points of\ndiminishing marginal returns, which means that when the mix of states\nchanges, in this case, when states drop out and their particular\ntechnologies and industries drop out with them, those points of\ndiminishing marginal returns shift, and they shift somewhat\nunpredictably, which means that the relevant cost threshold for a\ndifferent mix of states could be cheaper, and, with full candor to the\nCourt, it could be the same or even be more expensive. The problem is\nwe don't know. It is the unpredictability that renders this plan\nunreasonable as to any different mix of states.",

But I thought\nthat cost had to do with the technology and how much it costs to\nimplement, so I don't see why that woul d be different among the 50\nstates or marginally important enough to be different.\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nOf course, Your Honor.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd to the extent that the other states dropping out don't increase the\ncost for any of the remaining states, they --their allotment remains the\nsame regardless of how many people are participating. So I don't see\nhow you're raising an argument, frankly, not for yourself because\nnothing's changed.\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nWell, Your Honor, let me take that in reverse, and I'm happy to go down\nthe gritty path of the technical details. But, before that, the allotments\nmay not change in the way the EPA has executed the plan, but the\nallotments themselves are wrong when the EPA fails to consider what\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI --I -- I -- say it, but show me.\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nSure, Your Honor. The answer goes, again, to the methodology, which I\nkeep calling the point of diminishing marginal returns question, and I'm\nhappy to go step by step into what is admittedly an extremely gritty\nmathematical problem.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy don't you get to the end question. Nothing is changing in your cost\nor what you have to do, meaning the states that are -- who -- for whom\nstay -- stays have not been given, their allotment doesn't change,\nnothing changes.\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nAgain, Your Honor, you're talking about the execution of those\nallocations, but the allocations themselves are now wrong, and what I\nmean by that is the EPA's method of selecting a single cost threshold.\nNow that goes to looking for points on a graph where an additional\ndollar spent produces little to no additional emissions reductions. Those\npoints on that graph change unpredictably, erratically, when the mix of\nstates changes.",

And one of the reasons usually we\ndon't take cert on a case is if it has a lot of stuff before you get to the\nmerits issues, which is the only thing that we would be concerned about.\nAnd it --it does seem to me you want to -- the term \"stuff,\" sometimes\nreferred to as vehicle issues, there are just a lot of them here, right?\nThere's the question of did you have to comment and did you\ncomment? Then there's the question of, well, even if you couldn't\ncomment but --because you didn't know enough, should you have filed\na motion for reconsideration? And you didn't file a motion for\nreconsideration. Then there's this very complex issue about how your\nquestion relates to the validity of the SIP disapprovals themselves\nbecause, if the SIP disapprovals were valid, you wouldn't have a leg to\nstand on here. So how are we supposed to know that in this posture? So I\nguess what I'm saying is there are so many hoops that you have to go\nthrough and you have to go through all of them. You have to run the\ntable before we could even begin to get to your merits question. Isn't\nthat, according to our usual standards, a reason to deny this\napplication?\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nJustice Kagan, you've given a lot of stuff associated with this case, but\nthere's one thing I really want to talk about, which is what happens if\nthe SIP disapprovals ultimately settle in a place where all 23 states end\nup staying in the plan. That doesn't change our argument. The problem\nis the EPA failed to consider in the first instance what happens when\nthere is lesser participation. This is something that it doesn't matter\nwhat's going to happen next.\n### Justice Kagan:\nWell, that's sort of interesting. That doesn't seem intuitive to me. I\nmean, if all these lawsuits that the states are bringing are going to end\nup losing, I mean, the idea that you can be here and be demanding\nemergency relief just because states have kicked up a lot of dust seems\nnot the right answer to me.\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nNo, that's not right, Your Honor, be cause, in this very unusual\ncircumstance under the statute, as well as the EPA's choice of method, it\nis relevant to look back at what Your Honor has just termed \"kicking up\ndust.\" But it's not kicking up dust because, first of all, the legal flaws\nwere quite obvious, and they were previewed by commenters, and then\nvery shortly afterwards litigation and then the stays came around, all of\nwhich the EPA had an obligation to engage in rulemaking with its eyes\nwide open. Now, why that matters, I gave you two reasons: the unique\nstatutory circumstance, as well as the EPA's choice of method. The\nstatute itself requires the EPA to look back to prior predicate rulemaking\nin order to assert its authority to have a federal plan, and necessarily\nbaked into that is the fact that there may be judicial intervention,\nespecially by the EPA's own doing.\n### Justice Kagan:\nWhat do you think the EPA should have done? I mean, there are 23 states\nhere.\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nMm- hmm.\n### Justice Kagan:\nWas the EPA required to sort of consider every permutation, you know, if\n22 states are in the plan, if 21 states are in the plan, if 13 states are in the\nplan, if five states are in the plan? Which states are they? One of my\nclerks who does math better than I do tells me that there are two to the\n23rd power, which is like 4 million different permutations. What was the\nEPA supposed to do?\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nWell, I'm not going to go as far as to say that the EPA had to do\nnecessarily every possible permutation of two to the power of 23 minus\n### Justice Kagan:\nUgh.\n(Laughter.)\n### Justice Kagan:\nI have to tell my clerk it's minus one. (Laughter.)\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nis acknowledge the problem. So we're very far from talking abou t the\nline-drawing things that you're talking about. What the EPA had to do\nwas consider whether, under this method, it would need to address\ncontingencies. And we're familiar in other areas of law where --for\nexample, in elections law, where you run a number of simulations and\ndecide, you know what, we have a critical mass of a particular solution.\nLet's apply that. Let's go ahead with that.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.",

But the Court also asked whether the\nemissions controls in the rule are reasonable regardless of the number\nof states that are involved. The answer is no for three primary reasons.\nFirst, the rule selectively ignores EME Homer's cost -effectiveness\nframework. Second, the rule over- controls across a number of\nindustries. And, third, the rule imposes an impossible compliance\ntimeline that will result in reliability issues across the country. I\nwelcome the Court's questions.",

So let me ask it in a different way. Could\nEPA have accomplished the exact same thing by reg ulating the states\nindividually as opposed to in a --as a interdependent group?\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nIt could not have accomplished the exact same thing,\n### Justice Thomas:\n, to\nthe extent that it would have to show, when you say \"exact same\nthing,\" that the outcome, the cost threshold and so forth, would be the\nsame across 11 states. But, to your question of Ms. Sridharan, I think the\nissue that you were looking for is evidence about what EPA did, and I\nwant to point you to 88 Federal Register 36741. Excuse me. \"When the\neffects of\" -- I'm quoting. \"When the effects of these emissions\nreductions are assessed collectively across the hundreds of EGU and\nnon- EGU industrial sources that are subject to this rule, the cumulative\nimprovements in ozone levels at downwind receptors, while they may\nvary to some extent, are both measurable and meaningful.\" That is the\nbest example of the collective question that EPA asked itself and\nanswered. Now, you know, Justice Sotoma yor, you asked the question\nabout cost and whether the obligations, for example, in Ohio would be\nthe same. But I think the question here is -- goes back to what this\nCourt approved in EME Homer. It's not just a question about whether\nEPA can regulate something that is inexpensive, potentially\ninexpensive. It's not a question about whether EPA can regulate\nemissions. It's a question about whether EPA has appropriately\ncalculated what it calls that knee in the curve, the point where the\nemissions contribution to a downwind state is controlled at a\nreasonable cost level. So I think the exchange that you had with Ms.\nSridharan about where that cost issue comes from has to do with the\nquestion about, if you've got 23 states and all of their EGUs and all of the\nnon -EGU sources that are linked into this rule all feeding into that cost\nquestion, what happens if you take out the states where maybe you can\ncontrol those costs most cheaply and you're left with states th at\nactually have much higher cost thresholds to impose on industries or on\nEGUs? That changes the cost calculus. It also changes, of course, the",

And all of those go to this question about that\ndifference between 23 and 11. But I want to bring home the point with a\n### Justice Kagan:\nI guess -- I guess my reaction is a little bit the same as -- that I -- I gave\nto Ms. Sridharan, is, I mean, this is at such a higher level of generality\nthan you're making the same argument now. You know, our briefs do\nnot really address this very complicated cost argument.\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nI think, Justice Kagan, the --the cost argument, while --while some of\nthe metrics, I think, are complicated, things like ozone modeling and so\nforth, the -- the bottom line is actually not that complicated. The\nbottom line is what EPA was supposed to do under the Good Neighbor\nprovision was to figure out, as it said in EME Homer and as it said it was\ndoing here, where is that cost threshold. That word, \"cost threshold,\" if\nyou go back and look at the rule in EME Homer, appears 185 times. But\nwhat the Court did -- what -- what the EPA did here with respect to\nnon- EGUs in particular is to look at the question about average costs,\nwhich is a completely different issue. Average cost is just how much do\nthese emissions control cost? Does that seem like a reasonable number?\nOkay, we'll apply them and see what emissions controls exist\n### Justice Kagan:\nI mean, the only point I was making --and I don't want to push you too\nhard on this because it's not your fault this is coming in a weird posture.\nI -- I don't even seem the term \"cost threshold\" on these pages.\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nI think the term \"cost threshold\" is -- is in the EPA's brief. It's a\nfundamental question about the way that EME Homer exists. If you look\nat the Kinder Morgan brief, there's a separate discussion of costs that I\nthink is particularly relevant to this. There are two different strands, I\nthink, that we're chasing here. One of them has to do with the 23 versus\n11 question, what happens when you take 12 states out. The other\nquestion has to do with how EPA went about calculating costs.

And EPA responded, you know, no, they're not, but even if\nthey are, we don't care, it's severable. That's a fine response if they then\ngo on and explain why it still works if it's severable, but that's goose\negg. They don't have an explanation there.\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nIt -- it is a goose egg. Page 36693 of the Federal Register contains the\nentirety of -- of what we'll call reasoning.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nSo all this discussion about the cost threshold, that's what they should\nhave explained if they're going to make the point, which is a big one,\nhey, even if 12 states drop out, who cares, because it still works. Okay.\nShow us how -- to",

      "target_dialogue": "## Justice Sotomayor\n### Justice Sotomayor:\n's question, show us how it works.\nBut that's -- that's their burden, I think, to show --to justify -- to not\nbe arbitrary and capricious.\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nYes. And, in fact, if you look at that page that I just cited, 36693, what\nyou'll see is it says, \"Should any jurisdiction- specific aspect of this rule\nbe found invalid, the EPA views the rule as severable. Should any\nindustry- specific rule be found invalid, the EPA rolls this rule -- views\nthis rule as severable.\" This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI'm sorry, whose burden -- that may be their burden below. But the\nburden here as I understand it is on you to show this. And we go back to\nwhat Justice Kagan said. I read the -- I read these applications pretty\ncarefully, and I didn't understand this cost argument at all. And I'm\nreally simplistic. I don't have a math degree, all right? If you're sharing\ncosts among 23 people, your cost is going to be less. If you' re sharing\ncosts among 11 people, your cost is going to be more. So, since this plan\ndoesn't change any allocations depending on the number of people who\nare in it, states are bound by the number that was calculated on the\nlarger group, how are the remaining states affected by the fact that\ntheir cost should have been higher, but it's not because it's been fixed at\nthis lower number?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI'm very simplistic. You know, cost divided by 23 is always less than cost\ndivided by 11 if your cost is going to stay constant.\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nThat's the question, though. And -- and I think,\n### Justice Sotomayor:\n, the\nBut does it matter? Meaning, if you're paying less on the wrong number\nbecause it was divided by 23, how could it be that on 11 your cost is ever\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nJustice Sotomayor, I -- I think so much of it has to do with the states\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nNo. My point is, once the states drop out, it doesn't matter what your\nresponsibility is because the cost is going to remain the same given the\nnature of this plan. They're not changing the cost once they've\ncalculated the responsibility of the 23.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nIf 12 are not paying it, what does it matter to you?\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nwas calculated where it was because EPA looked at the aggregate costs\nof controls over that --that Federal Register cite that I read you,\nhundreds of EGUs across all of the states, hundreds of industries' units\nacross all of the states. It figured out what that aggregate cost was and\nthen it decided to allocate obligations. So we keep talking about the end\nof that process, what --what obligations would change on a state based\non taking some states out.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nIt seems to me that if the aggregate is contributing to something and\nthere's a certain amount of people who for whatever legal reason have\nbeen taken out of the calculus, why should you pay for them or not pay\nfor them if the problem is a national one really, not an individual one?\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nI think, Justice Sotomayor, that that's actually EPA's argument, is that,\nyou know, it -- it makes sense to impose these emissions controls\nacross these industries because it will result in what EPA calls\nmeaningful reductions. Now I'd encourage you to look at page 36743\nand 36747 to figure out exactly the scope of those meaningful\nreductions of the '88 Federal Register final rule. What we're talking\nabout when it comes to meaningful reductions is on the order of a total\nof .66 parts per billion averaged across all of these receptors. Now\nthere's a bigger number involved. That number is, if you add all of the\nreductions from the receptors from Arizona to Connecticut and you add\nthem up, then you get a bigger parts per billion number, but that's like\nticketing me for speeding if I exceed the speed limit one mile per hour in",

Stewart:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to\nmake three quick points at the outset.\nFirst, with respect to the interests of the state applicants, I think it's\nimportant to bear in mind that at this stage of the proceedings, there\nare a lot more states on our side than there are on theirs, and it's vital to\nbear in mind the equities of the downwind states because that's the\nwhole point of the Good Neighbor provision of the Clean Air Act and the\n\"Good Neighbor Plan\" that the EPA implemented.\nAnd when we think about the interests of the downwind states, it's\nnatural to think first of their humanitarian interest in the health and\nwell-being of their residents. But the downwind states that are out of\nattainment also have a legal obligation to come into attainment by\ndeadlines specified by the statute.\nAnd to stay the rule in its entirety based on some theoretical possibility\nthat the contours of an 11-state rule might have been somewhat\ndifferent if EPA had anticipated all the stays would be terribly unfair to\nthe downwind states.\nThe second point is that in addition to the severability language that\nJustice Kavanaugh refe rred to, EPA in the preamble said that it was\nreserving judgment on whether several additional states should\nultimately be included in the plan.\nIt said that if any of the 23 states that were currently included devised\ncompliant SIPs, they could be taken out of the federal plan.\nAnd so EPA anticipated from the outset that the plan was one whose\ngeographic composition could change.\nAnd EPA devised the requirements for each state in order that they\nwould be workable if a smaller or a larger set of states were ultimately\ncovered.\nAnd then the last thing I would say is it's true that the federal plan is not\ncurrently providing the air quality benefits that EPA had hoped because\nthe stays of the SIP plan disapprovals mean it's only reducing emissions\nfrom 11 states rather than 23.\nBut, for those 11 states, the requirements that are imposed on sources\nare exactly the same as would have been imposed on sources in those 11\nstates if the full plan had been implemented.\nAnd the -- the applicants have suggested that it's -- it's possible that\nthe benefits associated with those requirements might have been\ndifferent if EPA had known that only 11 states would have been included.\nBut there's no reason to think that that's so.\nAs we look at it, the difference between three and zero is the same as the\ndifference between 10 and seven.\nthe 11 states are only delivering 30 percent of the benefits, they're still\ndelivering that -- that same quantum of air quality benefit.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Stewart:\nI think, when they refer to interdependence, they're --they're referring\nto kind of three topics that were discussed in the preamble.\nThe first was EPA took pains to point out that although it was engaging\nin a complicated inquiry to decide what emission controls could be cost\n-effectively imposed on different types of industrial sources, in the end,\nit was placing the same requirements on all of the covered states; that\nis, to do equity, it was saying that power plants in Indiana need to come\nup to the same standard as power plants in Texas.

Stewart:\nWe -- we -- if --if only the state was involved, we might have not have\nthought it was worth the tro uble to undertake such a comprehensive\ninquiry.\nNow, if all -- if 22 of the states had submitted compliant plans and only\none was left, EPA would still have had a statutory obligation to\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nOkay.\nIt's hard to stop you sometimes.\n(Laughter.)\nIf the current plan with the current number of states involved regulates\n11 percent of the EGU emissions that you anticipated with the 23 states,\nwould you have gone ahead with that?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI man, we would certainly -- again, if there had been any states, even\none, with non -compliant plans, EPA would not only have had the\nauthority but a statutory obligation to promulgate a federal plan for\nthat state and to promulgate a federal plan that it thought would ensure\nthat sources within the state didn't contribute significantly to\ndownwind non-attainment. And when I said earlier maybe if it was only\na smaller set of states involved, EPA would think as a matter of\ncost/benefit analysis it's not worth doing the whole enormous inquiry,\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nOkay.\nGot it.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nI got it.\nI got it.\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nOkay.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nNow, when -- if -- if you prevail here, when will EPA address the\nquestion that's raised about whether or not the fact that it's a reduction\nin terms of the number affected and a reduction in the number of states,\nwhen will EPA sit down and address that, and when --when will they\ngive an explanation rather than the litigants here?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI don't think that they have any plan to do that, first of all, because\nwhatever they might have done if they had been studying only 11 states\nat the outset, now that they've done the whole analysis, there would be\nno reason for them not to use what they fou nd in\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nIt's something new that you only regulate 11 percent.\nAnd in terms of why it's necessary to look at this here, if you think it's an\nimportant question, it's because EPA will not look at it until after the\nhundreds of millions of dollars of costs are incurred.\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI think part of the reason that we won't look -- look at it is that the\nground is still shifting; that is, EPA earlier in the year proposed to\ndisapprove the -- the plans of several additional states, which, if that\nultimately went forward as the -- the final decision, would result in the\naddition of those states to the plan.\nWe had a ruling from the Tenth Circuit at the end of the day on Friday\nsaying that that proceeding is being transferred to the D.C. Circuit, and\nthat could result in Utah and Oklahoma being put back into the federal\nplan.\nSo part of the reason it wouldn't make sense for EPA to do a sort of\nground-up inquiry is that, just as it was getting done with that, it might\nhave a new geographic composition to deal with.",

And the problem is we're not sure if\nthe requir ements would be the same with 11 states as with 23.\nAnd -- and it's just not explained.\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI -- I -- I think the comments were raised at kind of a lower level of\nspecificity than -- than you might imagine. That is, there were\ncomments to the effect that your federal plan is in trouble because valid\nSIP disapprovals are a condition precedent to the federal plan and the\nSIP disapprovals were bad.\nAnd to -- to a point, those commenters have been vindicated.\nThat is, several states have obtai ned stays of their SIP disapprovals, and\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nBut -- but, when the EPA came back, EPA said severability.\nSo EPA understood the comment.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nEPA understood the comment and came back and said, even if we have\nfewer states, we're going to plow ahead anyway, and then the question I\nthink that's raised is why and how.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAnd that's just kind of pretend nothing happened, just go ahead with\nthe 11 states in this instance.\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI think EPA understood the comment to be, to the extent that your SIP\ndisapprovals are challenged and either stayed or ultimately struck\ndown, your federal plan will be less effective.\nI don't think any commenter was saying specifically, if some disapprove\ncapricious as to the o ther states.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThe plan will become unworkable.\nThe cost, the requirements might change.\nAnd when EPA comes back, it doesn't explain anything on that.\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI mean, we -- we know that the --the requirements don't change.\nThat is, EPA imposed equivalent requirements on different -- on power\nplants, on steel industry sources, on pipeline engines, with respect to\nindustrial facilities in the same source category that are located in\ndifferent states.\nEPA imposed exactly the same requirements.\nAnd the requirements that are imposed on sources in Indiana and Ohio -\n- West Virginia is out for now because they got a stay -- but, in Indiana\nand Ohio, they're exactly the same as they would have been under an 11-\nstate plan. The -- the only argument that the applicants have is that\nmaybe imposition of those requirements on the same sources in the 11\nstates will produce lower air quality benefits downwind now that it's\nonly the 11 states.",

Stewart:\nYes.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nJust a couple of simple questions.\nHow often does EPA use a severability provision like this? My --my\nunderstanding, and it -- and I just -- is it's very rare, it's a handful of\ntimes in the last 10 or 15 years out of the thousands of rules it's\npromulgated.\nIs that right?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI -- I don't know how often they do it generally, but I do know that it is -\n- it's been a recurrent feature of these sorts of \"Good Neighbor\" plans\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nAm I right, though, that it's only a handful of times over the last 10 or 15\nyears?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI -- I would be surprised if it's only a handful, but I don't have\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nI found an article that said between 2000 and 2014 it was seven times.\nIs that -- do -- do you --do you have any other information?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI don't --I don't have any other evidence, but I -- I think, even with that\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nOkay, okay, okay, okay.\nOkay.\nMy other simple question is, could -- could EPA have done this on a\nstate-by-state basis? I mean, when a SIP is -- fails, the obligation\nstatutorily is for EPA to come up with a federal plan.\nWas that an option that -- that it considered?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI mean, in a sense, they did do that.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nNo, no, I'm -- they -- they did a 23 -state plan.\nOkay.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nSo I'm just asking, did they consider doing a state-by-state plan?\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nYes or no?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nYes.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nOkay.\nAnd -- and why didn't they do that?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nAnd they did it.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWell, all right.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nI -- I -- I -- we're talking past each other.\nWe have a 23-state plan that I understand has state by state.\nI get that.\nI'm just wondering, did they -- did they consider doing that without\nrespect to the 23 states as a -- as a -- as --as a collective?\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nYes, that is my question.\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nPart of the reason they didn't do it is that they thought by making it an\noverall federal plan, the trading program for the power plants would be\neasier to administer, it would be easier for power plants in -- to trade\nemission allowances with power plants.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nGot it.\nGot it.

Stewart:\nThere -- there was one -- there were two motions raising this issue.\nOne was a motion for reconsideration filed by U.S.\nSteel, which raised this issue and also raised a pretty complicated set of\ntechnical challenges specific to the steel industry.\nAnd there was another filed by AFPA styled a motion to stay that also\nraised the 11 versus 12. There is no deadline.\nThere is a mechanism for arguing that EPA has unreasonably been --has\nunreasonably delayed, but that hasn't been invoked.\n### Justice Alito:\nOkay.\nThe other question has to do with the fact that this is an emergency\napplication.\nWe now receive many applications for stays.\nSometimes your office seeks a stay.\nSometimes your office opposes a stay.\nWhat is your office's position on the question whether in this context\nwhat the stay applicant must show is some sort of super-irreparable\nharm? Is the applicant required simply to show irreparable harm, or is it\nrequired to clear some much, much higher threshold?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI -- I don't think that there is any requirement that it clear a higher\nthreshold, but I think in balance -- just showing irreparable harm is -- is\nnot enough, particularly if there are countervailing harms on the other\nside.\n### Justice Alito:\nNo, I --I understand that.\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nAnd the other point I'd make about the stay they are seeking is that they\nreally want a stay that will operate as a tolling principle.\nAnd by that, I mean if -- if the Court issued a stay tomorrow and then\ntwo years went by and we won in the D.C. Circuit and this Court denied\ncert and then the stay was vacated in February of 2026, the usual\nconsequence of vacating a stay would be that regulated parties would\nthereafter be subject to all the same legal requirements as they would\nhave been if no stay had ever been issued.\nBut that's not what they want.\nWhat they want, a rule is -- is a rule that says, if that happens, then all\nthe compliance deadlines in 2026 and thereafter will be extended by\ntwo years in light of the fact that a stay had been effect in two years.\nAnd so that would delay the operation of the most stringent",

And this seems like a pretty\nregular part of the EPA's business and maybe a regular part of the D.C.\nCircuit's business because that's true.\nAnd I'm -- I'm wondering if you would just say, is --is --is there\nsomething unusual about this case?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI -- I mean, one of the ways in which this case is very different from EME\nHomer is that in EME Homer, you had the same pattern of EPA rejecting\n20-some state plans and then implementing a federal plan, and there\nwere a very wide array of challenges to the federal plan in EME Homer.\nThey went through the D.C. Circuit.\nThey got up to this Court.\nThere -- there was very little litigation about the antecedent SIP\ndisapprovals.\nAnd so I think that that's one of the -- the unusual features of this case\nin comparison to prior cases involving Good Neighbor Plans.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo there hasn't been -- there --there haven't been other\ncircumstances in which this exact question has come up?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nRight.\nI think, in the EME Homer context, there were three challenges to SIP\ndisapprovals, and I don't know that any of them were ultimately\nresolved in the -- on the merits.\nAnd so there -- there wasn't this situation where preliminary orders\nentered in the SIP disapproval litigation caused people to argue about is\nthe plan still rational as to the states that remain.\n### Justice Kagan:\nAnd do you know what the D.C. Circuit intends to do or do you have a\nguess as to what the D.C. Circuit will do with respect to the interaction\nbetween the SIP litigations that are happening across the country and\nthe question before it?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI -- I don't have a clear sense of what they will do, and I think it will\ndepend in part on how does -- do the SIP litigation lawsuits progress\nwhile the D.C. Circuit is considering the case; that is, by the time that the\nD.C. Circuit is ultimately ready to issue a decision, we may have some or\nall of the SIP disapproval lawsuits resolved one way or the other, either\nin EPA's favor in which there are more states back in the plan, or if\nthey're resolved against EPA, then the D.C. Circuit can kind of take it as\ngiven that those states are out for the time being and can consider\narguments about what the consequences should be.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.",

Vale:\nIt comes from, I think, two things, one on either side of the balance.\nFor the upwind states, the rule is designed -- the way it -- it defines\n\"significant contribution\" is for sources to do the relatively less\nexpensive controls. I understand that there are still costs, but they are\nrelatively less expensive because it's based on having upwind states do\ncontrols that downwind sources and many other sources across the\ncountry have already done, for example, like turning on pollution\ncontrols on power plants that are already installed.\nThat's the lowest of the low-hanging fruit. By contrast, downwind\nsources, as they get the upwind pollution, they have to compensate for\nit, but they've already exhausted a lot of the less expensive strategies,\nso they need to turn to more and more expensive strategies to find any\nfurther cuts.\nAnd one of the reasons why sources have exhausted their less expensive\noptions is because of the statutory consequences of non-attainment.\nSo, in Section 7511, I believe (a), little (a), it is the Clean Air Act that puts\non more and more stringent requirements onto downwind sources as\nstates move into worse and worse levels of non-attainment.\nSo more and more sources need to put on controls, smaller and smaller\nsources need to put on controls, and the controls themselves get more\nstringent. By -- and -- and -- and I think that that's how we get into\nthis situation for the downwind sources.\nAnd the rule right now continues to provide substantial and meaningful\nbenefits to the downwind sources.\nIt is not a shell or a disaster.\nAnd that's because upwind pollution is not evenly distributed as it goes\ndownwind.\nSo the downwind states that generally get a lot of pollution from the 11\nstates in the rule now still stand to get a lot of benefits.\nSo, for example, in Wisconsin, the areas that struggle with air quality get\napproximately 40 percent of their ozone from the 11 states currently in\nthe rule, 13 percent from Indiana alone.\nAnd for Connecticut, the current scope of the rule gets it 65 percent of\nthe emission reductions compared to the full scope of the rule.\nAnd that relief for downwind states is also urgent because of the way\nnon-attainment works.\nNon-attainment -- those deadlines keep on coming regardless of\nwhether Good Neighbor obligations are fulfilled, even though the\ndeadlines, as the D.C. Circuit has made clear, are supposed to be aligned.",
