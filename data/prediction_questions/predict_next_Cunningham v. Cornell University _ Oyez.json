Section 1106.\nIn Congress's view, these transactions posed a special risk of being\npotentially harmful to the plan, generally because they involved a party\nin interest, which includes a fiduciary's relative or an officer or an owner\nof the plan or a person providing services to the plan.\nPetitioners here have identified a transaction that falls within the text\nof Section 1106, and the Second Circuit's decision to dismiss that claim\nprior to discovery was incorrect for three reasons. First, text and\nstructure.\nCongress frequently writes laws where it puts liability in one part of the\nstatute and exceptions to liability in another, and when it does so, this\nCourt has time and again held that plaintiffs plead and prove liability\nand defendants plead and prove exceptions to liability.\nSecond, precedent.\nIn Keystone Consolidated and Harris Trust, this Court made clear that\nthe prohibited transaction provisions provide for categorical rules.\nBut what the Second Circuit's approach does is it conver ts those\ncategorical rules into qualified ones.\nAnd that brings me to the final reason for reversal, which is that they're\nnot just qualified prohibitions, but they're qualified based on\nexemptions that involve information that plaintiffs cannot know and do\nnot know prior to discovery, information like who the counterparties are\nin a cross-trade or how large a block trade is or what asset classes are in\na block trade, which is exactly why, when Congress wrote these\nprovisions, it intended for petitioners to plead and prove under Section\n1106 and for defendants to plead and prove under Section 1108.\nFor these reasons, Your Honor, we ask this Court to reverse the\njudgment of the Second Circuit.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

They're going to do the\nrecordkeeping for it.\nSo all you need to do in your submission is plead something that is\nperfectly innocuous in and of itself.\nNow maybe the fees are too high.\nMaybe they're not.\nThat's a different question.\nBut all you need to do is plead something that seems to be on the\nsurface completely innocuous.\nThat's enough to get you beyond the motion to dismiss.\nAnd then, you know, how many -- how many lawsuits just like this one\ndid the Schlichter Bogard law firm in St. Louis file against universities?\n### Xiao Wang:\nWell -- well, Justice Alito, let me try to unpack that.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, answer the second question first.\n### Xiao Wang:\nAs to how many lawsuits were filed?\n### Justice Alito:\nYeah.\nHow many lawsuits just like this did that law firm file against different\nuniversities?\n### Xiao Wang:\nI -- I think it's filed a significant number.\nI don't have the specific number off the top of my head, but I would say\nthat --12, excuse me, and -- but I -- I would say, in the complaint itself\n### Justice Alito:\nI --I thought it was 20, but it doesn't matter.\nSo, you know, you file all these lawsuits, and maybe the universities are\ngoing to say: Look, it's going to cost us a lot of money to go through the\ndiscovery, we're just going to settle.\nAnd so there's a payday for the law firm.\n### Xiao Wang:\nCert -- cert -- certainly,\n### Justice Alito:\n.\nWell, I -- I think, first of all, in the amended complaint, we point out that\nnot every university is subject to suit.\nThere are examples, such as Loyola Marymount, California Insti tute of\nTechnology, Purdue, that have, in fact, I think, consolidated to a single\nrecordkeeper of -- had the recordkeeping fees below or at the industry\nbenchmark.\nThat's not the case here.",

We seem -- we were interested and did\nseriously tighten up the pleading standards there, and I wonder if that's\nsomething we should take into account in deciding how to allocate the -\n-the burden going forward here.\n### Xiao Wang:\nCertainly, Justice -- Chief\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\n.\nI think that the way that we would see it, if you will, is to imagine if you\nhave sort of three boxes of types of complaints.\nBox 1 is the bare-bones complaint that says: I'm going to sue you\nbecause you did recordkeeping. And Box 2 is, I think, something more\nlike what we see here, is to say: Look, I'm going to bring a suit because I\nsee that recordkeeping is tied to revenue sharing, and revenue sharing is\nitself tied to the investment management products that you offer, and\nyou happen to offer products that -- that promote your own services.\nThat -- that's Box 2. And then Box 3 is everything in Box 2, plus give us\nallegations as to the services and the fees and benchmarks then based\non information you don't know.\nI think what we would say --and I think this is -- this comes through in\nthe government's brief -- is that we would say that we don't see any in\nBox 1.\nWe don't see any cases in the Eighth and Ninth Circuit, and that is\nbecause of the guardrails that we talk about. But, if we were to start\nseeing them, I think, within the many tools in a district court's\ndiscretion, whether it's limited discovery, Iqbal and Twombly, Rule 7,\nthere's a number of ways to manage that litigation to make sure that\nBox 1 does not get out of hand.\nAnd if I could --I could briefly sort of respond to -- to one point that you\nmade in your --in your question,",

Standing is another one.\nWhat do you think you have to plead to establish standing? Do you have\nto plead anything more than that I am -- I am being charged for\nrecordkeeping services? Do you think you have to prove that the charge\nis excessive or do you -- in order to have standing at the pleading stage?\n### Xiao Wang:\nWell, Justice Alito, I think that that's a little bit of an open question after\nthis Court's decision in Thole. Certainly, I think, with Thole, perhaps one\ntake-away is that, yes, you would have to show, because simply\nshowing record -- simply alleging recordkeeping would be pleading an\ninjury at law and rather than injury at fact.\n### Justice Alito:\nSo all you have to plead -- you have to plead I was charged too much,\nand that's -- that's enough to establish standing?\n### Xiao Wang:\nI think, in the appropriate case, yes.\nHowever, I think that, again, this goes back to --to -- to the other\nguardrails that might be there, which are fee shifting and -- and -- and\nquestions about the -- the -- sort of the expense of even bringing one\nof these cases.\nSo -- so I think these all work together to explain why, in the Eighth\nCircuit and the Ninth Circuit, we don't see cases that have these sort of\nbare-bones threshold complaints.\n### Justice Alito:\nAnd what do you think about the procedure that the Solicitor General\nrecommended involving Civil --Rule of Civil Procedure 7?\n### Justice Alito:\nIs that -- do you think that's a possible -- that that is something we\nshould say is a --is a good practice?\n### Xiao Wang:\nI think that that is one of several options that would be available to a\ndistrict court to address perhaps these concerns over a bare-bones\ncomplaint.\n### Justice Alito:\nA district court could do that? A district court could say, after the answer\nis filed, I want a reply, and then rule on whether it can be determined\nbased on the pleadings if the defendant is entitled to judgment on the\npleadings?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCertainly, Your Honor.\nI think that's how we would see it.\nOf course, a district court could have other options available to it, such\nas limited discovery or an expedited summary judgment motion, as\nwell.\n### Justice Alito:\nDo you think that that's -- that should be mandatory for the district\ncourt to go through that -- well, I'll ask the Solicitor General that.\nI have no more questions.\nThank you.",

      "target_dialogue": "## Justice Sotomayor\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI do.\nThis isn't that easy a case in my mind.\nYou're right about the general rules we've set, but this statute is slightly\ndifferent because many of the cases that we've seen before, the\nprohibitions were on one page and the exemptions were in a different\nsection, but the prohibition didn't reference the exceptions the way this\nstatute does.\nIt says, except for the exemptions in 1108, you can't do the following.\nOn the other hand, there's 21 exemptions within 1108, but I also\nunderstand there's dozens, if not a hundred more, that have been\npassed by the Department of Labor.\nAnd if we accept the other side's position that you have to prove the\ncase and say there's no exemption, I don't know how you'd know that.\nYou're right, how will you know which exemptions are pertinent or not,\ncorrect?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCorrect.\nCorrect.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd so that's really the problem in this case, which is either -- whatever\nwe decide, someone's going to be potentially unfairly treated because\nyou have --no plaintiff has a way of knowing what all the exemptions\nare and what potential exemptions the other side could pick.\n### Xiao Wang:\nCertainly, Justice Sotomayor.\n### Xiao Wang:\nSorry.\n### Xiao Wang:\nApologies.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nOkay.\nThat's a given.\nBut, here, it's pretty clear that you alleged and you thought you had\nsome sort of burden because I read your very extensive complaint, and\n### Xiao Wang:\nCorrect.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nYou allege it's unreasonable.\nYou show a lot of other fees. I'm not quite sure still, and I will ask the\ngovernment this, under normal pleading standards, I would have\nthought this was enough.\nI think that the Second Circuit was thinking that it has to be pled with\nTwombly and Iqbal as a fraud and that you needed more particularized\ninformation relating to the nature of the services in total, some\ninformation that you say you couldn't have known.\n### Xiao Wang:\nYes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nYou just knew how much was being paid and you compared it to what\nother people were paying.\n### Xiao Wang:\nComparable plans, yes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nExactly.\nSo, if I have a problem with that part of it, that the Second Circuit may\nhave asked for more than you needed to plead, what do I do?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nEven if I accepted their proposition that you need to allege for whatever\nreason a pleading standard, injury standard, that you have to allege\nsomething more than that they have a transaction, do I get to address\nthat or I don't, or what am I doing here?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCertainly, Justice Sotomayor.\nI think that what you're doing here is -- is, first, I think you would\nreverse. We -- we would ask this Court to reverse the judgment of the\nSecond Circuit.\nAnd it would reverse by saying, look, you --if these are enough under\nIqbal and Twombly and it involves unreasonableness, then whatever\nrule you apply, we would still say that there was a legal error here. But, if\nI can get back to what I think may be the first part of your question,\nwhich is perhaps the relative weakness of our --of our decision about\nthe \"except as otherwise provided\" language at the top, well, first, I\nthink that precedent answers this point, and precedent answers this\npoint in a couple different ways.\nOne is Respondents have provided no cases where that actually changes\nthe calculus. It turns except -- the words \"except as otherwise\nprovided\" magically turns the word -- the exempt -- exemptions into\nelements.\nThere's no case on that point.\nIn fact, the cases like Atlantic Richfield and Schlemmer make fairly clear\nthat all that's doing is saying w hat happens when things clash.\nIt doesn't expand or contract the liability provisions at all.\nAnd I think, sort of maybe as a concluding point on this point, that is\nreinforced by the structure and the complexity and the nuance that's\nprovided in 1108 that involves an information asymmetry that -- that,\nagain, cannot be addressed prior to discovery.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI'm going to ask the other two about the Second Circuit factual ruling,\nwhich was that with respect to this provision, you have the burden of\nshowing unreasonableness, but it reserved consideration of whether\nthere were other exemptions that you didn't bear the burden about\nproving.\nI don't know how it got there at all.\n### Xiao Wang:\nRight.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd I'll ask the government and your adversary how we do that. But\nCook did say that -- established a narrow ruling for criminal pleadings.\nI don't think there's any case that ever has applied it to civil\nexemptions, correct?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCorrect.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo it's hard to rely on Cook, but the essence of its thinking was, if a\nprohibition looks like -- if a prohibition looks like it's -- you can't really\ntell it's illegal or not because the exemption here says you can have\nthese relationships, you can just have them with reasonable fees, then\nyou need for the -- for the government -- for the government to prove\nthey were unreasonable.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy wouldn't that apply here, that concept?\n### Xiao Wang:\nWhy wouldn't Cook's apply here?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nObservation.\n### Xiao Wang:\nYeah.\nI -- I --I think it wouldn't apply not simply just because of the\ncriminal/civil distinction that we talked a bout but also for the\ninformation asymmetries that you mention.\nAnd it doesn't sort of -- really, I think the Respondents are asking this\nCourt to sort of carve out the statute in a few different ways, to --to try\nto gerrymander it by saying: Look, we'll put the (b)(2) exemption, we'll\ntreat that as an element and we'll try to carve out service providers, and\nthen we'll stitch together 1106 and 1108.\nBut that's not how the statute is written.\nAnd, certainly, that might lead to some results.\nWe don't see that happening in the Eighth or Ninth Circuits, but, if it\ndoes, I think that's in Congress's province to address.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThank you.",

And at the beginning of the statute, it says that it was\n\"providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the\nfederal courts.\" So it appears that Congress did not really share the\nconcern about the litigation in this area that the amici in this case have\nraised.\n### Xiao Wang:\nThat's right, Justice Jackson.\nI think that with respect to Congress and this Court's understanding of\nCongress's intent in ERISA, it's to provide a broadly protective and\nremedial statute and provide an avenue for plaintiffs to --to enforce\nERISA's terms and conditions.\nAnd I think it's telling that simply that Respondents and their amici,\nespecially their amici, have, in fact, advocated for changes to 1106\nseveral times in the halls of Congress.\nCongress has declined to do that. It's kept the scheme as it is.\nAnd I think applying the text as written is appropriate in this instance.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThank you.",

Ms. Dubin.\n### Yaira Dubin:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text and structure of\nthis statute demonstrate that the 21 exemptions in 1108(b) are the\nfiduciary's responsibility to plead and prove, but, as already discussed\nthis morning, that straightforward reading raises a practical concern for\nthe subset of claims that are at issue here, that plaintiffs could obtain\ndiscovery simply by alleging a routine service provider transaction.\nImportantly, that theoretical concern has not materialized in the real\nworld, likely because courts have the necessary tools to weed out and\ndeter bare-bones complaints.\nAnd in all events, we don't think that concern justifies adopting\nRespondents' strange reading.\nCritically, service providers are just one of the nine categories of parties\nin interest.\nThe rest are plan insiders with whom transactions carry obvious risks of\nfavoritism and abuse.\nAll the usual interpretive rules indicate that Congress intended the\nfiduciary to justify such transactions.\nRespondents' elements-based approach would thus undermine the\nprohibited transaction provisions as a whole based on pragmatic\nconcerns about one sliver of party-in-interest transactions.\nThat approach is fundamentally unsound.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

I mean, earlier you said that it has to -- you have to say\nenough to make it plausible.\nAnd that suggests to me that that's a judicial requirement -- that the\ncourt has to -- if that -- if we say that's the standard, the court has to\nlook at it and determine whether it's plausible.\nI mean, is that --is that your answer, or is it we don't have to say\nanything?\n### Yaira Dubin:\nI was differentiating between what this Court says in an opinion\nresolving this case and what district courts do on the ground.\nI agree as to the first response that I gave, which is that district courts on\nthe ground should be evaluating plausibility. And I do think, if you failed\nat all to respond to an obvious explanation for the conduct that would\nrender it unlawful, that is a problem for a plaintiff.\nAnd I think that's perfectly within the judicial role to recognize that.\nAnd I think district courts and lower courts on the ground are doing this\nalready.\nAs to what this Court says in an opinion, I think it depends on how the\nCourt is weighing the various spillover consequences at issue here.\nBut this is all after you've gotten to the point, I think, where you've\nalready rejected Respondents' approach, which I think simply doesn't\nwork as a matter of the statutory scheme and has its own pragmatic\nconsequences. This is simply whether you want to address the \"this\nwould produce nuts results\" for these bare-bones complaints, and I\nthink this is the right answer.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you.

That's\nwhat I'm interested in.\nAnd I understand the argument that all that's necessary to be pled are\nth e elements of the -- the -- the -- the provision that creates liability.\nAnd those are the ones that I set out.\nAnd they --they say nothing about the reasonableness of the fees.\nI don't know how the reasonableness of the fees gets into the pleading\nrequirement if that's the way we go about it.\n### Yaira Dubin:\nSure.\nSo I think looking at this Court's decision in Iqbal, the language used\nthere was a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual\ncontent that allows a court to draw the reasonable inference that the\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\n### Justice Alito:\nIt's reasonable liability as to the elements, not reasonable liability as to\naffirmative de fenses that may or may not exist and may or may not be\nasserted. Anyway, I'll --I'll leave that there. There's been talk about the\nfact that there are ways -- I mean, maybe those who have concerns\nabout the practical implications of deciding the case -- of reversing the\nLet's -- maybe they are.\nOkay.\nLet's assume that there -- they are, there's some basis to it.\nAnd what you propose with Rule 7 does suggest that the government\nthinks there's a basis to it.\nSo, if all you have to do is plead what I've just outlined, what are the\nthings that district courts can permissibly do that would alleviate these\nconcerns?\n### Yaira Dubin:\nSo, in addition to applying what we think is the rule of Iqbal and\nTwombly in this context, I would say that they could also, obviously,\nengage in fee shifting; they can sanction attorneys who bring meritless\nlawsuits.\nI think both of those are ve ry much deterrents to these types of bare -\nbones suits being brought on the ground.\n### Justice Alito:\nDo you think Rule -- do you think Rule 11 sanctions are really -- that's\ngoing to do the job here?\n### Yaira Dubin:\nI do if plaintiffs are bringing --begin to bring bare-bones complaints.\nI'll --I'll point you to the Tenth Circuit, which said, you know, part of a\nreasonable attorney's pre-filing investigation must include\ndetermining whether any obvious affirmative defense bars the case.\nThe Seventh Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, and the Sixth Circuit have all said\nthe same.\nI do think a failure to investigate an obvious affirmative defense is a\nproblem for a plaintiff's case.\nAnd I think, you know, going back to what you were asking me, I do think\nit's relevant that -- that -- sorry, that Twombly and Iqbal were about\nthe elements, that was what was going on in those cases, but the thing\nthat was motivating the Court, the thing the Court was concerned\nabout, was that you're coming into a complaint without a plausible case\nagainst someone, that you have no theory of wrongfulness.\nAnd I think these bare-bones complaints share the same problem.",

And what\nare those complaints exactly, and what takes you out of that category?\n### Yaira Dubin:\nSure.\nAnd let me be very clear about this.\nI think Box 1 is a complaint that just allege s a service provider\ntransaction for routine services.\nThat's Box 1.\nBox 2 is a complaint that includes allegations like the ones we see here:\nthat the fees are excessi ve, four to five times the industry benchmark,\nthat there's a reason to think the plan is paying excessive fees, that\nthey're using multiple recordkeepers when they could have used one,\nthat he didn't engage in a competitive process for these recordkeeping\nservices.\n### Justice Kagan:\nTo me, that doesn't sound like a bare-bones complaint.\nAre you suggesting otherwise?\n### Yaira Dubin:\nThat's exactly our position here, which is that Box 2 is where the\ncomplaint should be.\nAnd, in fact, that is where the complaints that we're seeing on the\nground are, that suits being brought under this allege that there are\nexcessive fees and that there are reasons to think the fees are excessive.\nThat's actually what the practice is playing out on the ground, and I\nthink the practice is playing out on the ground that way because of the\nconstraints we've been talking about today.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo those are not ones that in any circumstance would raise the necessity\nof talking about affirmative defenses?\n### Yaira Dubin:\nThat is our view.

Maybe not.\n### Yaira Dubin:\nI --I'm happy to. Box 3 relates to the quality of the services.\nThat's what the Second Circuit held. The Second Circuit held that it\ndoesn't matter all this information that you've included about how\nexcessive these fees are.\nThis might be the Cadillac of recordkeeping plans.\nAnd if it's the Cadillac of recordkeeping plans, then those fees were\njustified.\nAnd the problem is that Petitioners have no way of knowing if it's the\nCadillac of recordkeeping plans.\n### Justice Kagan:\nBut I take it that as you survey the litigation here, you're -- you're\nsaying that most of these complaints or all of these complaints are Box 2\ncomplaints, not the kind of bare-bones complaints that would suggest\nsome special need to do Iqbal maneuvers?\n### Yaira Dubin:\nThat's right.\nThose are the ones we're seeing.\nAnd we haven't seen Respondents identify any bare-bones complaints,\nincluding in the Eighth Circuit, which has been applying this rule that\nPetitioners are advocating for for 15 years, and we think that's because\nof the constraints that are already operating.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.",

I thought the government's basic position\nor at least Petitioners' was that the problem with the Second Circuit's\nview was that it didn't recognize that the exemptions are, in fact,\naffirmative defenses and, instead, treated them as elements and that it\nwould be enough -- and maybe I'm wrong about this now given all the\nconversation that we had -- we've had, but that it would be enough for\nthe court to say: These are affirmative defenses, they are not elements;\ntherefore, the burden is, you know, on the defendant to establish them.\nI didn't know that this was an Iqbal/Twombly case, where the Court was\nbeing called upon to determine what the plaintiff -- the plaintiff had to\ndo, as opposed to determining that defendant bore the burden of\nestablishing these exemptions.\n### Yaira Dubin:\nI entirely understand where you're coming from.\nI think, to resolve the elements question, all you would need to hold is\nthat these exemptions are, in fact, affirmative defenses and not\nelements of the prohibitions for all the reason you heard already this\nmorning.\nHowever, I do think a real practical concern has been raised by the\nbench.\nIt hasn't materialized yet.\nWe haven't seen it in the Eighth Circuit.\nAnd I think that the government has offered an option for thinking\nabout how district courts will be dealing with complaints that raise\nthose concerns if they were to materialize in the future.\nWhether the Court decides to write that in an opinion and offer that\nguidance to the lower courts obviously I leave to the Court, but it is an\noption available to ensure against this concern that Respondents have\nraised.\nBut, even if you disagree with the government on that, even if you don't\nthink that that's an appropriate use of Iqbal and Twombly, it still\nwouldn't counsel in favor of adopting Respondents' approach, which is\na misreading of the statutory text.\nIt doesn't a ccount for the other party-in-interest transactions, it\ndoesn't account for the other exemptions, and it raises its own\npragmatic concerns.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd --and we wouldn't have to say those other things to resolve the\nexemptions question that was presented in this case?\n### Yaira Dubin:\nYes.\nThe other things that you referred to are really only in response to\nRespondents' pragmatic concerns.\nRespondents are saying: Don't do what you just said.\nDon't resolve the case along the, you know, straightforward Meacham,\nADA, Corning Glass, don't resolve this case along those lines because of\nthese pragmatic concerns.\nAnd to the extent the Court shares those concerns, we have offered that\nframework as a helpful tool.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThank you.",

Saharsky:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners' view is that\npleading the mere fact of a service provider transaction defeats a\nmotion to dismiss and a case could go forward.\nThat can't possibly be right.\nIf we look at this statute, it is unique, Section 1106(a), because it co vers\nan incredibly broad array of innocent beneficial conduct.\nIn fact, ERISA separately requires and encourages hiring service protect\nSection 1106(a) thus has to be read together with Section 1108 to limit\nthis cause of action to culpable conduct.\nAnd we know that in part because Section 1106(a) has this cross-\nreference to Section 1106 -- 1108, which says \"except as provided in\nSection 1108.\" You know, tellingly, there are two different parts of 1106\nhere.\nThere's (a), which includes all of this innocent conduct, and (b), which\nincludes only self-dealing conduct, and that cross -reference isn't in\nSection 1106(b).\nIt has to be doing some work textually, and it doesn't under Petitioners'\nprovision.\nIf you look at all of this together, it shows that Congress's intent was to\ndefine the cause of action as not just a service provider transaction but\none where there's some wrongful conduct, wher e the services are\nunnecessary or the fees are unreasonable.\nAnd under Petitioners' view, all a plaintiff has to do is plead the mere\nfact of a transaction, no allegation of wrongful conduct.\nIt automatically opens the door to expansive discovery.\nThe cost is disproportionately borne by defendants.\nIt would force settlements of meritless litigation.\nIt has in some of these university cases.\nThe ultimate result would be to hurt plan participants and beneficiaries.\nThe government recognizes that that is an intolerable result, and I'm\nhappy to discuss why its proposed solutions don't make sense.\nBut the bottom line is the Second Circuit got it right, and this Court\nshould affirm.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Saharsky:\nFor Section 1106 claims, they are elements of the claim.\nThey are not affirmative defenses.\nThe burden is on the plaintiff to plead them.\n### Justice Jackson:\nthe other side explains that this is a pretty common way in which\nstatutes are set up, that you have prohibitions and then you have\nexemptions and that we ordinarily say the burdens apply in the way that\nthey are articulating.\nAnd you don't normally see elements in this way.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nYeah.\n### Justice Jackson:\nWhat -- what's your response to that?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nThat's right, but this Court has many cases where it said that there are\nexceptions that are elements, and it -- the question it asks is: Do you\nneed the e xception to define the wrongful conduct? And Cook was a\n### Justice Jackson:\nAre all 21 exemptions elements in your view? And then what do we do\nabout the information asymmetry, the fact that plaintiff could not\npossibly know many of them?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nWell, the plaintiff only has to plead the one that's relevant on the facts\nof the case.\nAnd I think it helps to think that, you know, a case comes to a court to\nchallenge -- a plaintiff is challenging a particular transaction.\nEither it's a service provider contract or it's a certain type of buying of\nemployer stock or something else.\nAnd the different exemptions apply to different factual circumstances.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut are --but do they have to be consistent with respect to the burden\nthat you say falls on the plaintiff? Are they all elements, all 21\nexceptions?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nWith respect to 1106(a) claims, which include the exemption and\notherwise would be only innocuous conduct, then, yes, the relevant\nexception in Section 1108 would be an affirmative defense, but not all of\nthem would be relevant in every case on the facts.\nAnd I think you can think about this in terms of what a plaintiff has to\nplead to go forward with a complaint.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI'm sorry.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nI said that you would -- that a plaintiff would have to plead facts\nregarding the one that was -- regarding the transaction, the type of\ntransaction, that's applicable in their case.\nSo, for example, there are some that involve block trades or cross-\ntrades or buying employer stock.\nAnd no one was doing any of those things here, so there's no\nrequirement to plead those kind of facts.\nThe plaintiff's burden is not to plead legal conclusions but to plead facts\nthat show an entitlement to relief.\n### Justice Jackson:\nNo, I understand the plaintiff's burden generally.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nYes.\n### Justice Jackson:\nelements in the 1106 context.\n### Justice Jackson:\nYeah.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nincludes every kind of transaction you could imagine with a plan, the\nonly thing that the Petitioners say is exempted is the thing that this\nCourt exempted in the Lockheed versus Spink decision, which is paying\nbenefits to a beneficiary, but it covers pretty much everything else in the\nworld.\nThe definition of \"party in interest\" is literally an \"everyone and their\nmother\" provision.\nAnd so these -- this broad range of transactions has to be understood\nwith respect to the exemptions in Section 1108.\nAnd, yes, they would be elements as applied based on the facts of the\ncase.\nBut you just plead the facts that are relevant to the transaction at issue.\nAnd so, for this transaction, there was never any question that what was\nat issue was a service provider transaction.\nThe exception that was relevant was the one for -- for reasonable fees,\nnecessary fees, et cetera.\nAnd if, for some reason, there was a case in which a plaintiff pleaded and\n### Justice Jackson:\nCan I just -- can I -- can I ask you about potential problems for other\nstatutes that are created in this same way? I mean, do we have to worry\nthat if we're suddenly saying that the exemptions in this structure are\nelements that we're going to implicate things like the Federal\nArbitration Act, which has a similar dynamic?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nI don't think it's a problem because this Court considers each case and\neach statute as it comes.\nThat's what it has been doing since the decision in Cook, where it said,\nlook, if we look at something and it's called an exemption and it's in a\nseparate provision, we probably would think it's an affirmative defense,\nbut there are some circumstances in which we don't, say, if there's a\ncross-reference to the provision or it's direct -- there's some other way\nthat it's directly incorporated or, for example, if the conduct that is in\nthe initial prohibition covers so much beneficial innocuous conduct that\nyou think we can't define the wrongful thing that Congress was trying\nto get at without -- without using the exemption.\nAnd that's the inquiry that this Court has done, and that's the inquiry I",

Saharsky:\nRight.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAnd -- and the context would seem to be key on that.\nAnd some of the concerns that we've been discussing or I've been\nraising and the amicus briefs raise, others have raised, would suggest\nthat this -- the context here suggests it doesn't make much sense to\nread this 1106(a) that way.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nRight.\nSo I'd point the Court to four factors.\nOne, the incredible breadth of Section 1106(a), which reaches so much\ninnocent conduct, nothing wrongful, not limited to wrongful conduct by\nitself.\nThen you have the cross -reference, which says: Okay, we don't have to\nread it by itself.\nWe're being told that we should read it with Section 1108, which is what\nlimits it to the wrongful conduct.\nAnd then you don't see that cross -reference in Section 1106(b), which is\nthe one that defines only wrongful conduct, only transactions that\ninvolve self-interest in conduct.\nSo you think I've got to give some meaning to that language that's in\n1106(a), the cross-reference, but not in 1106(b). Petitioners' view does\nnot give any meaning to that language.\nIt is superfluous.\nAnd then the fourth thing I think about is that there are other parts of\nERISA where Congress either encouraged or expressly required the use\nof service providers.\nAnd I think to myself: Well, Congress said that plans have to do this and\nevery plan does it, so it would make no sense at all to say that Congress\njust defined the cause of action as using a service provider.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nIf I put that all together, I'd have to come out that this would be part of\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nSo, on the context, you're pulling in the other statutory provisions too.\nI think that fourth point's pretty important.\nAnd then another point, I just want to be crystal -clear on this because\nthe other side says: Well, what about the insider transactions? And\nthose are 1106(b), correct?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nSo 1106(b) are when the fiduciary -- the fiduciary has conflicts of\ninterest, self -dealing.\nThose are all on their face bad transactions.\nI understand the argument that the other side of the government is to\nbe making is: Well, maybe 1106(a) is also like that because parties in\ninterest include insiders.\nBut they include a lot of people who aren't -- aren't involved in\nconflicted transactions.\nThey include service providers.\nI mean, it is an -- the immense breadth of the party-in-interest\ndefinition is -- is hard to describe.\nBut I think the point of that is is that you need a way to limit the 1106(a)\nprovision, and the cross-reference tells you to do it using the\nexemptions.",

Another one is\nstanding, expedited discovery, coupled with a motion for summary\njudgment, fee shifting, sanctions.\nWhy are -- are they not sufficient?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nRight.\nBecause the rule is that a plaintiff has to come to court and plead the\nelements and doesn't have to plead affirmative defenses.\nNow, if the Court -- and that's -- that's how Iqbal and Twombly are\nunderstood. That's what it means to bring a claim to court and plead\nfacts to show an entitlement to relief.\nIt's entitlement to relief on -- on the elements.\n### Justice Alito:\nOkay.\nWhat about the Rule 7 workround?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nSo we think that that is kind of convoluted and discretionary and that's\nthe problem with it . First of all, there would not be an opportunity to\nRule 11 -- Rule 7 just applies to an answer.\nSo the Court has discretion about whether the Court can -- whether it\ncan -- it asks for a reply brief or not.\nSo I guess what the government is thinking is the plaintiff pleads the\nmere fact of a service provider transaction.\nThe defendant says no, this --it is a --for reasonable fees and necessary\nservices.\nAnd then, at that point, the court should exercise its discretion to\nrequire the plaintiff to plead additional facts to show that the fees are\nunreasonable or the service is unnecessary.\nThe problem with that is that it's discretionary.\nA plaintiff could go to a district court that's favorable, not -- the district\ncourt would say: I don't want to do that.\nAnd then it's off to discovery and off to summary judgment.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, could we say that in the --in the particular circumstances here, it\nwould be an abuse of discretion for the district court not to follow that\nprocedure?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nThe Court absolutely could say that.\nI guess my suggestion would be is that the Court should be very clear if\nthat's what the Court wants, because that's not the way that things\nhappen now with respect to Rule 7. And so the Court would -- would\nhopefully say that in those circumstances, in --in the case of a service\nprovider transaction, that if the defendant alleges that the fees were\nreasonable, the services were necessary, something in Section 1108,\nthat then the district court absolutely should require the plaintiff to\nrespond and plead facts to show, plausibly show, that the fees were\nunreaso nable. I mean, our bottom line, which I understand to be the\nsame as the government's bottom line, although I'm not entirely sure,\nis that the plaintiff should not be able to just come to court and say\nthere was a service provider transaction, that's bad, we're off to the\nraces with a lawsuit.\n### Justice Alito:\nOkay.\n### Justice Alito:\nsummary judgment motion?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nSo I will address each of those, but let me just say none of these\nsupposed solutions or guardrails are working now in the district courts,\nand that would be before the Court announced a rule that you could\nperhaps just go in with a service provi der transaction.\nAnd just one point on that.\nYou know, there have been two dozens lawsuits that have been filed\nagainst university plans.\nIn none of them has a court found that the plaintiff succeeded on the\nmerits.\nThis has been, like, millions of dollars that these universities have spent\non discovery and individuals who have been named personally and had\nto live under a clued for years and years.\nSo this idea that there are these great guardrails that are going to solve\nthat problem, that's not happening now, and that's before Petitioners'\nposition gets accepted.\nBut, to -- to specifically answer your question, I don't know that\nstanding is a solution because standing, establishing an -- an -- an\ninjury for standing is different from establishing an entitlement to relief\nunder a cause of action.\nI don't know what injury a plaintiff might claim.\nI mean, I think Petitioners' theory is that the mere fact of paying money\nto a service provider is an injury because Congress decided that that was\nbad or at least presumptively bad.\nSo now there's been a suggestion that the injury would be unreasonable\nfees, but I -- that --that, to me, gets us back to, well, aren't the\nunreasonable fees part of the elements, so the cause of action.\nSo I -- there's also the possibility of jurisdictional discovery and\nstanding, which, you know, makes it seem to me like not a very great\nsolution.\nAnd I guess the last thing I would say on that is, you know, if -- if -- if\nthere is a standing problem or a -- some other constitutional problem\nwith the statutory interpretation the Petitioners are suggesting, that\nwould be a good reason not to do that thing and to take the other\nreading of the statute, which is much more reasonable.\nI mean, nearly every court that's looked at this and, you know,\napparently, the Solicitor General say Petitioners' position just can't be\nright, that just cannot be right.\nAnd there has to be a way to make sure that the plaintiffs have some\nburden to plead something more.\nAnd there's a really obvious way to do that, which is to say, well, in this\ncircumstance, we understand that Section 1108 helps to define the\ncause of action, to say that this is actually something that the plaintiffs\nhave to plead.\nAnd I -- just to get back to a -- a point",

There's\nmaybe a handful of factual circumstances where -- that have been\nlitigated in the courts of appeals that involve fees for services,\nparticipant loans, some cases with buying employer stock or property,\nlike employee stock ownership cases, things like that.\nThere's kind of a handful of these.\nI don't think any of them have led to circuit splits.\nI don't think that there's --there should be much concern about the\nCourt, you know, adopting a rule that's going to have spillover effects\nfor any of those.\nAnd so I guess, you know, what we would say is that the Court should\ndecide this case just as it decides, you know, all of the cases that come to\nit, which is on the language of this particular provision.\nAnd we appreciate that the government is, you know, trying to help find\nthese solutions to the problems with Petitioners' position, but I think,\nat the end of the day, they're not happening.\nThey're not working now. I think they're discretionary.\nI -- I -- I -- the suggestion about, like, well, maybe there could be\nexpedited discovery or not much discovery because you could just look\nat the face of the service provider -- the contract and see if it's good or\nnot good, well, that hasn't been happening in these cases.\nI mean, the -- the --there have been experts on both sides to discuss\nwhether the fees are reasonable or not.\nYou know, discovery has gone on for years and years.\nThese university cases started in 2016, and they're still going on now.\nSo I just would caution the Court before thinking that any of those\nsuggested solutions would be real solutions.\nCould you just go back to the suggested solution of the government?

Saharsky:\nSure.\nSo, if the solution is that a plaintiff has to plead unreasonable fees or\nunnecessary services, then that is a great result, but we just want that to\nbe clear, that that is the obligation that the district courts would\nenforce.\nSo there are two ways that the government suggests getting there, and\nthey both seem kind of convoluted to us and also have this discretionary\naspect that we're concerned about.\nThe first way that the government suggests is on motion to dismiss.\nThe idea would be that in response to a motion to dismiss, that a\nplaintiff would have to plead additional facts to show that the fees were\nunreasonable or the service is unnecessary. But, like, why would the\nplaintiff have to plead that, because it's not an element? The\ngovernment says it's an obvious alternative explanation.\nWell, we think that that misunderstands, for the reasons Justice\nGorsuch gave, what the obvious alterna tive explanation doctrine is.\nIt's like a reason that the element isn't met.\nLike, in an antitrust complaint, the allegation could be, well, a whole\nbunch of companies did the same thing. But an obvious alternative\nexplanation is, well, they --they all did the same thing because of\nmarket forces.\nSo it wasn't that they did, you know, the bad thing, which was a\nconspiracy.\nHere, what Petitioners define as, you know, the bad thing is jus t the\nservice provider transaction.\nAnd the fees being reasonable isn't an alternative explanation for\nwhether there was a service provider transaction or not. It's like an extra\nfact. Now, if the Court wanted to revisit Iqbal and Twombly and say that\nit also imposes a burden on plaintiffs to negate affirmative defenses,\nthat would be terrific.\n(Laughter.)\nBut it would be, I think, a --a sea change in the law that would have\neffects well -- well past this case. So that's their Option 1.\nAnd then I think we've discussed a little bit more their Option 2, which\nwas Rule 7.\nSo Option 1 was for the motion -to-dismiss stage.",

Saharsky:\nI -- I just think, if the --if the Court wanted to pursue a Rule 7 solution,\nit should, please, make clear that that is something that district courts\nhave to do because it is discretionary and there's not judicial review of it,\nand these cases could go on and on and on.\nI would like to say one other thing, though, about Rule 7 and --and this\nparticular case, which is, so assuming that the plaintiffs do have some\nburden to plead unreasonable fees, we think the Second Circuit correctly\nfound that they didn't plead it here and that this Court, you know,\nordinarily doesn't review that kind of holding, like the application of a\nlegal principle to particular facts, but, if it did, you know, it would be\nclear here that there's, like, no reason for a remand.\nSo just to --just to explain what the Second Circuit did, you know,\npleading that fees are unreasonable, of course, is just a legal conclusion,\nso you need some plausible facts to show why they're unreasonable.\nHere, you know, there was an allegation that the fees were too high, but\nthere wasn't any allegation of what the services were for or that there\nwere other university plans that had comparable services that had much\nlower fees.\nAnd that's all the Second Circuit was saying.\nIt didn't say anything about Cadillac plans.\nIt just said, like, we don't know if something is too high unless we know\nwhat it's for.\nWe don't know -- we need to know, you know, what services it's for.\nIs it more services? Is it fewer services? Is it better services? And that's\nnot a weird rule in the Second Circuit.\nThat's actually the same thing that, like, the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth,\nTenth Circuits have said in these unreasonable fee cases, which is you\ncan't just plead, like, high fees in the abstract and say they're too high.\nYou have to give us some plausible facts as to why they're too high,\nwhich are, you know, compare them to something else that's like your\nplan where they didn't pay those kinds of fees. And so, you know, we\nthink the Second Circuit was exactly right to say that.\nThe only other thing I'll say just because the government put this in\nissue is that, you know, there's no point in a remand in this case because\nthe plaintiffs actually had the opportunity to try to adduce, you know,\nevidence through years and years of discovery to try to show that the\nfees were unreasonable.\nThat was, I think, as",

And I think that's just one common instance of the fact\nthat it's not a class of one.\nI think this leads me to the second and sort of final point I'd like to\nmake, which is, you know,",

And, as a practical matter, the\nEighth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, these other courts that have adopted\nthe standard that we advocate, we don't see cases on the ground that\nsuggest that any such solution is needed.\nSo, for those reasons, Your Honor, we ask this Court to apply the text as\nwritten and to reverse the judgment of the Second Circuit.",
