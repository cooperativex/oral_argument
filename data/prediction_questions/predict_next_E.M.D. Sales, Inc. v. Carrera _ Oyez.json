  "background": "E.M.D. Sales Inc. (EMD) is a distributor of Latin American, Caribbean, and Asian food products to grocery stores in the Washington, D.C. area. Three of EMD’s sales representatives—Faustino Sanchez Carrera, Magdaleno Gervacio, and Jesus David Muro—sued EMD and its CEO, Elda Devarie, in 2017 for allegedly violating the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by denying them overtime wages. The plaintiffs claimed they worked about 60 hours per week, paid on commission without overtime compensation. The sales representatives were assigned routes of stores, spending most of their time servicing chain stores and some independent groceries. Their duties included restocking shelves, managing inventory, and submitting orders for EMD products. While they could make some sales to independent stores, their ability to make sales at chain stores was limited, as high-level negotiations between EMD management and corporate buyers typically determined product placement. EMD argued that the sales representatives were exempt from overtime pay under the FLSA’s “outside sales” exemption. The case went to a bench trial, where the court had to determine whether the plaintiffs’ primary duty was making sales, qualifying them for the exemption, or if their work was primarily incidental to sales made by others. The district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, finding that EMD failed to prove the outside sales exemption applied, awarded both unpaid overtime wages and liquidated damages, but limited the damages to a two-year period after concluding that EMD's violation was not willful. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.",

Blatt:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For over a century, this\nCourt has held that the default standard in civil cases is preponderance\nof the evidence.\nThat default rule should resolve this case.\nNothing in the text suggests that Congress intended a clear and\nconvincing evidence standard to apply to the 34 exemptions under the\nFair Labor Standard -- Fair Labor Standards Act.\nRespondent --Respondents argue that a heightened standard is\nappropriate because FLSA rights are important.\nBut a preponderance standard applies to rights against race\ndiscrimination and disability discrimination and rights to organize and\nto workplace safety, all super-important rights. This Court has reserved\nthe clear and convincing standard to deprivations by the government of\ncritical rights that don't involve money damages.\nThis Court has never allowed plaintiffs to use a clear and convincing\nstandard as a sword, and it certainly has never read a clear and\nconvincing standard into a statute for money damages.\nRespondents also argue that overtime rights aren't waivable.\nBut waivability and standards of proof are unrelated and don't go hand\nin hand.\nWaivability goes to who owns the right, the government or the\nindividual, and the standard of proof goes to how hard it is to prove that\nthe right attaches in the first place.\nThus, the preponderance of the evidence standard governs non-\nwaivable rights, such as those under the NLRA and OSHA, and\nheightened standards govern waivable rights, such as those in criminal\ntrials and deportation hearings.\nBecause the court below applied only the clear and convincing standard,\nwe think this Court should remand for the application of the\npreponderance standard.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Blatt:\nSure, a couple things.\nI mean, I do think public nature goes to the waivability, and as my\nopening talked about, that's a distinct issue in terms of standard of\nproof.\nBut, more importantly, the public has an equal interest in the accurate\nimplementation of the Act, and this Court in Encino said the exemptions\nare equally a part of the statute. And the public has an interest in\nmaking sure, if it's more likely than not an employee doesn't fall within\na category and should be exempt, then, under a clear and convincing\nstandard, that employee may be required to pay overtime even when\nthe purposes of the statute are not only not --not invoked, but they're\ncounterproductive because it imposes very unjustified costs,\nparticularly under small businesses.",

I think\nthat's the phrase.\nBut, when it's minimum wage, it's not mere money in the same way, I\nguess, to follow up on the Chief Justice's question.\nHow are we supposed to make those value judgments, I guess?\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAre you saying -- and, relatedly, are you saying we should never expand\nthe category of where we've done clear and convincing, the Addington\ncategory?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nOr are you saying that this is different in kind from the Addington\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nYeah.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nSo both.\nLet's be clear, I think there's only two ways to get there.\nYou have to do it by the Constitution, which is Addington, or the statute.\nAnd it's true that the 1966 case would be where this Court said\ncongressional silence means it's left up to the judiciary to make an\nindependent determination about these kinds of things.\nBut starting with Grogan and certainly by the time of Octane Fitness and\nHalo, this Court has basically treated it as an absolute sort of we look at\ncongressional silence and that's dispositive.\nNow I will say that I've not been able to think of a statutory right where\nCongress has not addressed a burden of proof that involves a\ndeprivation up to, like, deportation and denaturalization, which were\nthe two examples where this Court read it in, but if this Court wanted to\nleave that open, I don't think you need to do it as a \"well, we'll just\nthrow up our hands and do what we want,\" but more of a background\npresumption against which Congress legislates.\nCongress presumably knows, in the '40s and '50s, you set out a kind of\nrule that if it was a particularly important deprivation, not involving\nmoney damages, then the Court will read into a clear and convincing\nevidence.\nBut I don't think -- I do think it is a question of congressional intent\nultimately.\nAnd, again, I -- I have not been able to think of an example.\nAnd I think it is significant that Congress has both codified, superseded,\nand overruled the deportation and denaturalization contexts.\nCongress went in and, you know, very carefully said when it wanted\nclear and convincing in deportation, overruled it in the denaturalization.\nIt's hard for me to think of a case involving a deprivation of an interest\nthat comes close to the Constitution, like the, you know, civil\ncommitment or -- or right to -- to your children, that doesn't involve\nmoney damages.\nAnd I don't think it's -- it would be right to go down to overtime, which I\nthink involves highly compensated employees, and to go down this road\nof, well, how important is race discrimination as opposed to sex\ndiscrimination or religious discrimination and start saying these are\nsemi -fundamental rights too and Price Waterhouse already put this to\nbed and said we're going to have a preponderance of the evidence\nstandard.",

You asked us to vacate and remand.\nThe SG wants us to reverse, which usually suggests to me that they\nthink the judgment below can't be sustained under any reading.\nAnd the other side says, regardless of the standard, affirm.\nOur practice is to remand.\nBut what outcome could a different standard of proof have on the\nfactual findings in this case?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nSo let me address just sort of the -- I don't think at least we intended\nany difference between vacatur and reversal.\nWe just copied what the Court did in the Starbucks case because it\ninvolved a similar misapplication, so we just took identically what you\nsaid in your opinion.\nI don't think the government's --I think the government and -- and we\nboth just think send it back.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWell, I don't disagree just for a moment.\nI do think the other side says this was harmless error.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nOf course.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right? So I don't think we should get into that.\nThe court below should.\nBut I'm asking you, why isn't it harmless error?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nRight, yeah.\nSo we think the ultimate --we think there's more than ample evidence\nfor the Court to find and will find below by a preponderance of the\nevidence.\nAnd the main reason -- and the regulation is cited at page 43A of the\nthis is an outside salesman -- it's not the time spent, but it's the most\nimportant, i.e., the character and time spent is one factor but not\ndispositive.\nAnd the four things that we would point to --and I think, again, the\nevidence is -- is great for us -- one, it's the testimony of the CEO, which\nis that just when she started the business, your job is to make sales.\nIt's to push that inventory and to increase the product.\nAnd, second, there were three salesmen that said that the sky was the\nlimit for them and their ability to make sales at chain stores and they\nlost track.\nThird, there was testimony of the Walmart former buyer for sauces and\ndressings and either he or she --I can't remember -- said that\nplanograms, which are basically your floor plans for your inventory\nshelf, that those were honored in the breach.\nIt's true that the Safeway and Giant people said we can't control where\nwe put the food, but the Walmart person said: Listen, sometimes we let\nthem, you know, sell us more tortillas or whatever they were selling and\nget more space.\nAnd finally, and the fourth one, and I think it is important at least to our\nclient in terms of common sense, they are called sales representatives,\nand the collective bargaining unit designated them as such, and nobody\ncomplained about overtime.\nSo this was a, you know, longstanding provision in the -- in --in the\nCBA.\nSo I think all of those things would lead to a sufficient basis.\nAnd the only way this Court could find harmless error, of course, would\nbe to find that no reasonable fact finder could find by a preponderance\nof the evidence.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nOn the last issue you raised, which was the collective bargaining issue,\nthis right of o vertime is not waivable by an employee, correct?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nCorrect, prospectively, yes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nBut you're not using it in that sense.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nNo, not at all.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nYou're using it in the sense of what they perceived as the most\nimportant part of their function?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nAbsolutely correct, that it was just the union, you know --and they were\npaid on a commission basis.\nIt necessarily wasn't based on new sales.\nSo this is more completely atmospherically inconsistent with their title,\nnot in any way -- not in any way binding.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThank you.",

And\nto be fair to the Fourth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit did say in that decision,\nit was talking about who had the burden, but it did say the employer\nwould have to put clear and affirmative proof forward.\nAnd then later the Tenth Circuit said: But what we meant by that was\nnot clear and convincing evidence.\nWe were just -- you know, you weren't supposed to take us literally.\nWe just meant you have -- the burden is on the employer, but it's just a\npreponderance of the evidence.\nAnd the Fourth Circuit just never deviated from it.\nThey have been asked twice en banc to overrule it, and they've declined\ntwice to overrule it.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nCorrect.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nCorrect, yeah, just the Tenth Circuit.\nNow -- and I don't think -- again, we tried en banc, and I don't think\nthe Fourth Circuit has ever articulated a rule.\nAnd it is somewhat noteworthy that they've only applied it -- I mean,\nthey're doing it in the overtime case too, which seems, you know, the\nleast policy basis for it.\nAnd the only other thing I just want to say on the preponderance of the\nevidence is the district court said just in the connection of the hearing,\nthere's a lot to be said on the liability question.\nObviously, a throwaway. The district court's going to make its own\nindependent decision on remand, but we don't think there's anything\nthat could be said where this Court sitting as -- as nine members would\nfind that no reasonable fact finder could conclude that a preponderance\nof the evidence wasn't satisfied.",

The cases -- many of\nthe cases that are cited are actually post-1938 cases.\nSo what's the best evidence that Congress was actually legislating\nagainst the preponderance of the evidence standard?\n### Lisa S.

      "target_dialogue": "## Justice Jackson\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut what do we do about the fact that the money damages here are\nactually, I thought, doing more significant work than just providing\ndamages in that particular scenario? So, I mean, when Congress enacted\nthe FSLA --the FLSA, they talked about the fact that there were\ninterests at stake that were beyond money damages, that setting up the\nstatute in the way that they did ensured that businesses don't gain a\ncompetitive advantage by misclassifying employees.\nIt protects certain groups from substandard wages and thereby\nprotecting health and well -being. There was also the notion of\nspreading employment through the application of this law. So isn't this\nmore than just money damages? I mean, I take your point that it might\nnot be denaturalization, but I would think the government would say\nthe interests go beyond just pure money damages.\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nCertainly, we recognize there are very important policy interests at\nstake in this case and in the FLSA and that Congress legislated with\nthose in mind.\nI think the same thing is true for Title VII.\nIt's not just about the individual employee who's seeking damages.\nIt's about the broader interest in eradicating discrimination from the\nworkplace.\nCongress often makes these policy findings in its statutes where it lays\nout all of the interests that are at stake here, an d those can be\naddressed through a variety of means, for example, through this\nwaivability issue or waivability aspect of the statute where it can't be\nwaived.\nAnd so that is how some of those policy concerns are addressed.\nBut the heightened standard of proof has just never been used as the\nkind of tool that would -- that would be addressed in those kinds of\ninstances. Otherwise, I think it would -- it would risk making that\nstandard no longer -- the preponderance of the evidence may no longer\nbe the default standard in those cases because those kinds of interests\nare --are very frequently at stake when Congress is legislating.\nI -- I wanted to just make a couple -- a couple of points if there are no\nfurther questions on --on that.\nThe Respondents have -- have asserted the variety of reasons to depart\nfrom the default here, and the Court has never accepted those kinds of\nreasons in cases dealing with conventional remedies.\nAnd I think it's important here to note that no court has actually\naccepted them because the Fourth Circuit here, as Ms. Blatt already\ndiscussed, did not actually come up with any reasoned basi s for the\ndecision.\nIt -- it misconstrued this earlier precedent, but it never tried to\nreconcile the heightened standard of proof with the Court's precedents\nhere and with the -- the very narrow set of circumstances in which the\nCourt has suggested that it would be appropriate.\nSo the -- the reasons that Respondents have provided here are\ngenerally the policy interests in --in -- in overtime requirements,\nwhich, again, we agree are important, but other statutes also implicate\nvery important reasons. And, as this Court held in Grogan, I think the\nexemptions here are also a part of the congressional policy and are also a\npart of what Congress was doing when it was balancing the interests\nhere.\n### Justice Jackson:\nCan I ask you, is this the same standard of proof that would apply to the\ngovernment, the Department of Labor, if it is bringing suit to enforce\nthe FLSA?\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nYes, it's the same standard of proof.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd it's the same standard that the Department of Labor applies in its\nown administrative proceedings?\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nSo the Department of Labor does it -- the Department of Labor enforces\nthis statute through district court litigation.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThrough the courts.\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nSo it would always be the -- the same standard.\nOPM -- there are other administrative --OPM administers it for the\ngovernment on behalf of --of government employees, and those go\nthrough litigation as well and the same standard.\n### Justice Jackson:\nDoes the government have an idea of how often the standard of proof is\ndispositive in a case like this or any other?\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nIt's difficult to say.\nI mean, the amicus and --and the parties here have tried to kind of point\nto various cases where they think the standard may or may not have\nbeen dispositive.\nIn the Department of Labor's cases, its own litigation, where -- where\nwe might have more of an idea, the standard of proof I think is -- is\npretty rarely dispositive, but that's likely because most of the litigation\nin the context of the Department of Labor is about the interpretation of\nan exemption or, you know, whether an employer is -- an employee is -\n- is covered by the FLSA at all, whether they are an employee or an\nindependent contractor.\nSo, in those cases, in the cases that the Department has --has litigated,\nI don't think it often makes a huge difference, but it certainly can make\na difference in edge cases here, and I think that the Petitioners should\nbe given the opportunity to show that this is one of those cases.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd one final question --oh, sorry.",

      "target_dialogue": "## Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you. Anyone else? No? Thank you, counsel. Ms. Bateman.\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When neither the\nConstitution nor any statute sets a standard of proof to govern a\nparticular factual determination, the degree of proof required for any\ngiven claim or defense is a question traditionally left to the judiciary.\nHere, application of the clear and convincing standard of proof is\nnecessary to carry out the explicit public purpose of the Fair Labor\nStandards Act.\nSection 202(b) of the Act declares that it is designed to eliminate as\nrapidly as practicable labor conditions that fall below a minimum\nstandard of living.\nThe preponderance of the evidence standard falls short of that purpose\nbecause it allocates the risk of factual error equally between employers\nand workers. But the FLSA is not your typical civil statute where only\nindividual monetary damages are at stake, and so, as far as the public is\nconcerned, the interests of plaintiff and defendant are in equipoise.\nInstead, it's a statute that prot ects both the worker's right to a fair\nday's pay for a fair day's work but also the public's right to an economic\nsystem that doesn't depend on and inexorably lead to the\nimpoverishment and immiseration of the American worker.\nCongress implicitly recognized in Section 202(b) that the social\ndisutility of a factual error that deprives a worker of minimum wages or\novertime to which he's entitled is greater than the social disutility of\nimposing those costs on the employer.\nAnd that lopsided disutility analysis, under principles long recognized\nby this Court, calls for requiring the employer to prove an exemption\nclearly and convincingly.\nIt's also appropriate because employers are likely to possess and control\nevidence relevant to these kinds of factual determinations.\nAnd employers can and sometimes do manipulate evidence in their\nfavor, such as job descriptions or titles.\nUnchecked, these factors lead to disproportionate errors of fact finding\nin favor of employers.\nThus, it's sensible to insist that where an employer seeks to prove that\nan employee is exempt from these protections, the employer must do\nso clearly and convincingly.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Bateman:\nI think the key difference between the FLSA and Title VII is waivability.\nAnd Title VII vindicates certainly extremely important rights, but\nalthough Title VII vindicates a public interest, it doesn't expressly create\na public right separate and independent from the right that accrues to\nthe individual. And I think an example might be illustrative here.\nAn individual can feel free to sign a severance agreement saying: I agree\nto waive any Title VII claims that might have accrued during the course\nof my employment for $50.\nBy contrast, this Court has said that private waivers of FLSA back wages\nor liquidated damages would, and I quote, \"nullify the purposes of the\nAct.\" So you cannot waive or compromise those claims unless there's a\nbona fide dispute as to the amount owed.\nSo, if an employer were to do the same thing in the FLSA context and say\nthat he would settle his claims for $50 and it was later found that the\nemployee was owed a hundred dollars of back wages, that waiver just\nwouldn't be operable.\nThe Department of Labor or the employee could still pursue that\nremaining $50 in litigation.",

Bateman:\nCertainly.\nI think Petitioners' methodology is inconsistent with the way this Court\nhas actually analyzed standards of proof issues, and I think the\nimmigration cases are a really great example.\nStarting in Schneiderman, this Court grappled with the standard of\nproof in denaturalization proceedings, and those proceedings took\na host of evidentiary directives, but it didn't contain a standard of proof.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut isn't that because they were sort of -- I think everyone concedes\nthat there's this kind of special category of cases that based on their\ninterest, whether it's a constitutional interest or sort of quasi-\nconstitutional because of the nature of the deprivation, due process\nkind of thing, the Court has work to do.\nBut I thought we sort of got rid of that at the top by sort of assessing this\nnot as being in one of those categories, and so then the question\nbecomes: How does the Court treat it?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nWell, I --I think, again, the immigration cases are -- are a good\nexample.\nAnd I -- I take Your Honor's point that perhaps there's a quasi-\nconstitutional interest at play.\nBut -- but that interest is never articulated by the Court in\nSchneiderman or -- or in Woodbury.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut what do you do with Grogan? I mean, I thought from then on, the\nsort of way in which we thought about this was Congress --you know,\nthere's no constitutional interest here, Congress didn't speak to it.\nSo what does Congress's silence tell us about what it intended with\nrespect to the cause of action that it was creating?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nI -- I think cases like Grogan and Herman & MacLean are illustrative that\nour view of the methodology is the more accurate one because, in those\ncases, the Court did undertake a balancing analysis.\nIt didn't just observe a statutory lacuna and decide: Well, certainly,\npreponderance of the evidence applies.\nIt -- it weighed the interests at stake.\nAnd --and granted, in those cases, it determined after that weighing\npreponderance of the evidence was the relevant standard.\n### Justice Jackson:\nDid it do so on the basis of the Court's own view of the interests in stake,\nor was it trying to ascertain how Congress viewed those interests?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nI -- I think the -- the structure and nature of the statute is relevant to\nthe court's determination of how it manages these factual questions.\nUltimately, of course, courts will answer these sorts of procedural\nquestions consistent with general principles that have emerged from\nother cases.\nAnd those principles, I think, do embody a default rule in a weak sense,\nwhich is that when there's a statutory lacuna, those -- those questions\nare reserved for -- for the courts and that in civil litigation, issues tend\nto be decided under the preponderance of the evidence, unless the\nreasons that courts have developed for exercising a more stringent\nstandard apply.\nSo I think the question here is whether those reasons are present in this\ncase.",

There's a big statement of purposes there.\nIt's necessary to preserve life and -- and everything else.\nAnd so, if you want -- if you're suing somebody under that, why aren't\nthey put to -- they, the polluter -- a higher standard of proof to prove\nthat they're not doing --they're not polluting the environment, they're\nnot endangering people's lives and -- through the -- through their\nemissions?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nAgain, I would say, if -- if Congress hasn't spoken as to the evidentiary\nstandard of proof, then the Court has to determine, using a host of\nfactors, including the importance of the right, what the operative\nstandard of proof ought to be.\nIt's -- it's really a question of judicial administration.\nAnd because, here, the right is nonwaivable, that --that suggests that\nCongress did believe that this is --this is not your mine-run civil -\nlitigation-type case where only individual monetary damages are at\nstake.",

Are there really no other nonwaivability rules of\nthe same kind? And, if so, where did this one come from? Why does it\nexist?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nI think it --yes, it is unique, and I think it exists because of this Court's\njurisprudence interpreting the Fair Labor Standards Act going back to\nBrooklyn Savings Bank, where it's such an important right to preserving\n### Justice Kagan:\nWe created it, not particularly based on any statutory language?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nWell, I think this Court was fairly interpreting the statutory language in\nthat to waive any portion of it would nullify the purposes of the Act.\nAnd I think that goes back to the public rights that -- that are enshrined\nin the Act.\nOf course, the minimum wage is designed to eliminate, you know,\nsubstandard conditions for the individual, but it's also designed to\neliminate the competitive advantage enjoyed by goods produced under\nsubstandard conditions.\nSo that's sort of the public valence of the -- the minimum wage\nprovision.\nIn terms of the overtime provision, it's not just meant to protect the\nindividual from the evil of overwork but also designed to increase overall\nemployment by widening the distribution of work.\nAnd both of these provisions really only work if --if they're adopted\neconomy-wide. Otherwise, it permits bad actors to enjoy competitive\nadvantage, and it disadvantages good companies who -- who wish to\nadhere to the regulations.",

We -- rights aren't waivable.\nThe NLRB certainly thinks those rights are not waivable, and so does\nOSHA.\nThose are both workplace rights.\nAnd I just cited in the brief the workplace ones, and there's throughout\nthe U.S.\nCode nonwaivable rights, but we could talk endless about Article III.\nI don't think that's waivable either.\nAnd we could ta lk about who's public and why that's in there, but all\nkinds of separation of powers issues.\nNo one thinks that we start importing burdens of proof into Article III\nrights.\nAnd then just on the -- the bit about sort of the policies of the Act, after\nEncino, you know, half the statute is the exemptions, and, by definition,\nif it's more likely than not that an employee is exempt, that means the\nnature of the employment is such that the employer can't hire more\nworkers because, if there's a salesman or a manager or an\nadministrator, you know, they have certain routes, certain sales\nrepresentatives, and what happens is the employer will just pay the\novertime, and, ultimately, especially for small businesses operating at\nthe margin, you're just talking about laying off workers.\nAnd thank you.",
