  "background": "Gentner Drummond, the Attorney General for the State of Oklahoma, filed an action against the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board and its members seeking to invalidate their contract with St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. St. Isidore, supported by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa, aims to operate as a Catholic virtual charter school. In creating this contract, the Charter School Board recognized religious rights and entitlements for St. Isidore, which deviated from the standard expectation that charter schools remain nonsectarian under Oklahoma law. On June 5 and October 9, 2023, the Charter School Board approvingly voted for St. Isidore's application and contract, both by a 3-2 margin. The contract omitted standard provisions prohibiting religious affiliation while affirming St. Isidore’s religious mission, which the State contends violates the Oklahoma Constitution, the Oklahoma Charter Schools Act, and the Establishment Clause of the federal Constitution. Consequently, the State requested a writ of mandamus to rescind the contract, arguing that the use of public funds for a sectarian institution contravenes legal and constitutional prohibitions. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma assumed original jurisdiction and granted belated relief to the State, holding that the contract violated state and federal law, including constitutional provisions prohibiting government establishment of religion.",

      "target_dialogue": "## Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe will hear argument this morning in Case 24-394, Oklahoma\nStatewide Charter School Board versus Drummond, and the\nconsolidated case.\nMr. Campbell.\n### James A. Campbell:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Oklahoma's\ncharter school program relies on private organizations to create more\neducational options, and it empowers those groups to innovate by\ngiving them broad autonomy over their mission, curriculum, and\noperations. Fueled by private ingenuity, those schools are thriving as\nthey specialize in diverse subjects like Native American culture and\nenvironmental stewardship.\nBut state law categorically bars religious groups and programs, deeming\nreligion to be the wrong kind of diversity.\nThat religious exclusion violates the Free Exercise Clause.\nThis Court has held three times in the last eight years that when a state\ncreates a public program and invites private actors, it can't exclude\npeople or groups because they're religious.\nThe Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board is committed to this\nprinciple of religious neutrality.\nThat's why it approved St. Isidore's application based on the strength of\nits proposal, refusing to reject the court -- the group because of its\nfaith.\nBut Respondent won't tolerate groups like St. Isidore operating in the\nprogram, so he sued to exclude them.\nHe now argues that the First Amendment, specifically the Free Exercise\nClause, is irrelevant because St. Isidore is part of the government.\nBut it's not.\nSt. Isidore was privately created by two Catholic organizations, and it is\ncontrolled by a privately selected board of directors.\nUnder this Court's tests, St. Isidore is neither the government nor\nengaged in state action.\nThere are already hundreds of families that have signed up for St.\nIsidore.\nThey're part of Oklahoma's community too.\nThey should not be treated as second-class. I welcome the Court's\nquestions.",

      "target_dialogue": "## Justice Thomas\n### Justice Thomas:\nWell, the argument is that either you are engaging in some sort of state\nisn't the normal context in which we see that -- and that you are a state\nentity.\nYou're a public school, a public Catholic charter school.\nAnd I think you should address that because those seem to be at the crux\nof the -- of the differing opinions and the argument.\n### James A. Campbell:\nYeah -- yes, Justice Thomas.\nSo, to start with governmental entity, there are two requirements that\nthis Court has established.\nThe first is state creation, and the second is state control.\nThere's no state creation here because St. Isidore was established by\ntwo private Catholic organizations and they applied to participate in a\nprogram.\nThey built their own charter school program.\nThey came up with their own startup funding, and they asked to be a\npart.\nThat looks nothing like what this Court has found to be state creation in\ncases like Lebron, Biden, and Arkansas.\nIn all of those cases, the entity was created by name through special\nlegislation.\nNor is there government control here because St. Isidore is operated by a\nprivately selected board.\nAgain, in all three of the cases that my friend on the other side cites,\nthere was a state-selected or a government -selected board, and that's\ndifferent from this case because, as he admits, we don't have that here.\nNow why does that matter? It's critical because a state-selected board\nhas government control within the organization.\nAll we have here is government oversight outside of the organization.\nAnd this Court has been clear in its state action cases that government\nregulation from the outside is not sufficient to constitute state control\nfor -- or --I'm sorry -- is not sufficient to constitute state action, let\nalone control, for purposes of governmental entity analysis.",

Because I\nunderstood that charter schools actually had to be -- their -- their\ncurriculum was reviewed by the board and it has to be evaluated and\naccepted.\nIs that not so?\n### James A.

Campbell:\nAnd you can see it's very high-level.\nBut, yes, the board reviews it as part of the application to ensure that\nthis school is going to provide a quality education to its students.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd so --so -- so how does the board do that if the curriculum includes\nreligious components? I mean, what -- what input or oversight or\nability to actually review that does the board have?\n### James A. Campbell:\nIt --it's the same way that the board would provide review for a school\nthat focuses on native American culture.\nIt's not going to dive into the details of the subject matter -specific\ntopic that the school wants to focus on.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut it does have a duty to sort of assess whether or not that curriculum\nmeets state standards.\nAnd when the curriculum is religious, I'm just wondering, don't we have\nthe kinds of entanglement issues that the Establishment Clause worries\nabout?\n### James A. Campbell:\nNot -- not at all, because the state board does not get into the details of\nthe -- of the curriculum, particularly any kind of subject matter\ncurriculum.\nWhat the state board is looking for is whether the state standards are\nsatisfied.\nThe state standards require things like math and reading and language\narts.\nThat's what the state board is concerned with.\nIt doesn't second -guess those specific subject matter details.",

Campbell:\nIf --if it required, like, a statement of faith in order for admission to the\nschool?\n### Justice Kagan:\nYeah, if it required a statement of faith, if it said we only want to educate\nchildren of our own faith, would -- would that be the same? You know,\nbecause -- because I could make the same arguments that you just\nmade: Oh, it was -- it was, you know, created in some sense by private\npeople and, you know, it --there's a private board. But -- but --but this\nwant to educate children of our own faith.\nWe do insist on a statement of faith. Would -- would your argument\nhave to apply to that too?\n### James A. Campbell:\nI think the argument and the analysis would be different because this\ncase involves a categorical religious exclusion and facial religious\ndiscrimination.\nSo, under this Court's precedent in Carson and the cases that came\nbefore it, we have a lack of neutrality on the face of the law, so we go\nstraight to strict scrutiny.\nAnd strict scrutiny isn't satisfied here because Respondent only has\nanti-Establishment Clause interests that have been rejected by this\nCourt in cases like Carson.\n### Justice Kagan:\nI guess I'm just not -- maybe I'm just being dense, but I'm not\nunderstanding.\nIf -- if your argument is, look, this is not a public entity, it's a private\nentity, and so it has to be treated equivalently by the government,\nthat's still true in the hypothetical I gave.\nSo why would there be any difference in outcome?\n### James A. Campbell:\nBe --because the challenge here is to the facial religious discrimination\nthat says: If you have any sectarian program, you can't be a part of the\nprogram.\nBut there's a separate requirement to get in to the program, which\nrequires that the school be open to all.\n### Justice Kagan:\nWell, I guess the question is: Why is a school allowed to strike some\nrequirements but not strike other requirements, right? Like, Oklahoma\nlaw ha s a requirement of nonsectarianism, for example. Essentially,\nwhat St. Isidore's did was it struck that from the contract.\nSo the next school says: We want to strike from the contract --I mean,\nSt. Isidore did some other things too, right? It --it struck out the\nnondiscrimination provision because of doctrines like the ministerial\nexemption or church autonomy principles.\nSo the next school says: We also want to strike from the contract the\nrequirement that we teach children of all faiths.\nI would think that your argument would have to apply the same way.\n### James A. Campbell:\nIt would be different analysis in those cases.\nAnd if --if we just take a step back and consider how Free Exercise\nClause jurisprudence works, whenever a litigant wants to challenge a\nspecific requirement by the government, then it has to focus on that\nrequirement and show that it's either not neutral or not generally\napplicable under the case law in Smith.\nSo, if someone wanted to challenge the requirement that the school be\nopen to all, they would have to show that that requirement is not\nneutral or not generally applicable, and if they can show that, then they\nwould proceed to strict scrutiny.\nAnd, at that point, the State would have a very different interest than it\nhas here. The State's only interests here are already rejected\nantiestablishment interests.\nThe State's interest in that case would be very different, the interest in\nensuring that the school is open to all.",

How is this -- that different from this case? Or is it? Are\nyou saying that anytime the government contracts for anything, it must\ninclude -- not a religious person, because your charter school doesn't\nwant to just give a secular education, it wants to give a religious\neducation.\nSo what you're saying is that -- does the government have to accept the\nreligious landscape?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThere's a contract here with the archdiocese, meaning the contract is\nwith a corporation that is run by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and\nthe Diocese of Tulsa.\nThey provide all the teachers.\nTheir handbook requires students to attend Catholic mass.\nYou say there's an exception for that.\nBut it requires students to --to support the school's mission.\nPart of that mission is to participate in the evangelizing of the church\nand to be a genuine instrument of the church.\nYour school doesn't want to be just a charter school.\nIt wants to be a religious charter school.\nCorrect?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nand Carson said this, Trinity said this, and, basically, every religious\ncourt --case we have --that the essence of the Establishment Clause is\nthat we're not going to support people -- lay lead -- religious leaders in\nteaching their religion.\nDo you accept that proposition?\n### James A. Campbell:\nI -- I don't accept it if it's part of a neutral and generally acceptable\nprogram.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWell, that -- that's an interesting question.\nSo, if we decide to fund just a Christian school and no other school, you\nsay that would violate the Establishment Clause, correct?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nBy --all right.\n### James A. Campbell:\nIf the government's picking and choosing religions, then, yes, that\nwould.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\nIf we pick and choose, as we did in one part of our history, only Catholic\nschools to teach Indian children so they can become Catholics, would\nthat violate the Establishment Clause?\n### James A. Campbell:\nIf the government is picking and choosing a particular religion and not\nagreeing to allow other religions into the program, then that would be\nan Establishment Clause violation.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\nAnd, here, they're not teaching other religions, correct, they're only\nteaching the Catholic religion?\n### James A. Campbell:\nSt. Isidore is, but the program is open to other religious applicants to\napply to teach other beliefs.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSure, if they don't teach religion.\n### James A. Campbell:\nWell, under our theory, it would be open to other religious organizations\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo what you're basically saying, there's no longer no play in the joints.\nThis has nothing to do -- there's no Establishment Clause really.\nWhat you're saying is the Free Exercise Clause trumps the essence of the\nEstablishment Clause because the essence of the Establishment Clause\nwas we're not going to pay religious leaders to teach their religion.\nThat was, is, and has always been the essence.\nAnd, here, we're paying Catholic leaders, Catholic teachers.\nYou can only be a teacher in this school if you're willing to accept the\nteachings of the Catholic Church. Then we're willing to say the free\nexercise provision trumps the Establishment Clause.\n### James A. Campbell:\nWell, one factual point.\nIt's not true that St. Isidore only hires Catholic teachers.\nIt hires teachers that aren't Catholic.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nBut they have to teach it within the morals of the Catholic Church?\n### James A.

Campbell:\nI disagree that these schools look just like traditional government -run\nschools.\nThey don't.\nIn fact, the baseline rule under the Oklahoma Charter Schools Act is that\nnone of the rules that apply to government schools are applicable to\ncharter schools unless the Act otherwise specifies.\nSo there are dozens of other requirements that charter schools are not\nsubject to.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThey're subject to the same financial audit and reporting requirements.\nThey're subject to the same state testing requirements.\nAll curricular changes have to be approved.\nIn the end, the curriculum can't go forward except for state approval.\nProficiency standards are set by the state.\nStudent suspension requirements are set by the state.\nI mean, this is -- these are state-run institutions.\nThey give the charter schools a good deal of curricular flexibility because\ncurricular options in the school system.\nBut, with respect to a whole variety of things, the state is running these\nschools and insisting upon certain requirements.\n### James A. Campbell:\nThe state is not running these schools.\nThese schools are run by the privately selected board of directors of each\nof the schools.\nAnd, if you look in particular at the Oklahoma statutes, specifically\nSection 3 -136, subsection 7, it says that all authority is vested in those\ngovern -- in those governing boards of the schools.\nAll that the state is doing here is exercising contractual oversight.\nOne of the assumptions of your question as I'm understanding it is that\nthe word \"public\" equals government-run.\nBut it clearly doesn't, not under this Court's case law, where the Court\nhas recognized that things like public access channels, public utilities,\npublic defenders, public accommodations, none of those involve\ngovernment-run entities.\nThey all, at least in many instances, involve private actors.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.",

Campbell:\nYeah.\nOne reaction is most of those examples that were provided in those\namicus briefs came from the early 1800s, and no one understood the\nEstablishment Clause to be incorporated against the states at that\npoint.\n### James A. Campbell:\nI'm sorry.\nYou're right.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nI take --I take that point, but there were state equivalents to the Free\nExercise Clause under a state constitution, and their point is, even there,\nthere -- there were no challenges.\n### James A. Campbell:\nAnd -- and I would say that this case doesn't involve those state\nequivalents.\nIt involves the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.\nNevertheless, I do think the history that we cite is important for\npurposes of this case because it dispels any suggestion that there is an\nEstablishment Clause violation.\nAnd in terms of the free exercise issue, I think that's satisfied --that\nthat issue is foreclosed by Carson because this Court established the\nprinciple in Carson that said you can't create a program, invite everyone,\nbut exclude the religious.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nAnd then your friends on the other side and -- and amicus there too\npointed out that it's important under state law for state charter schools\nto be considered state entities for -- for purposes of securing bonds,\nthings like that. And I took your response in your reply brief to say they\ncan continue to do so because what we're asking is whether it's a public\nentity for federal law purposes.\nI think that's a fair summary of what your response is.\n### James A. Campbell:\nI think that's fair.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nAnd I'm just -- I'm curious, do you have other examples of entities that\nmight be treated as private for federal law purposes but public for state\nlaw purposes?\n### James A. Campbell:\nI -- I have -- I have one example that involved Congress treating an\nentity as private and this Court treating it as public.\nSo it's not a state-federal divide, but it is a separation-of-powers\ndivide.\nAnd that's in the Lebron case.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nYeah.\n### James A. Campbell:\nCongress declared Amtrak to be a private actor, but this Court looked at\nit from a constitutional perspective and said that it constituted an arm\nof the government.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nLast question. You've emphasized the lack of creation and supervision\non the board.\nI -- I can imagine some states might respond to a decision in your favor\nby imposing more requirements on charter schools, in some states, to\nrequire public s to be on their board and -- and more involvement in the\ncreation of these institutions.\nHave you thought about that boomerang effect for chart er schools?\n### James A. Campbell:\nWe have thought about it, and that certainly is a decision that states are\nentitled to make.\nThey can set up their charter school programs as they see fit.\nWe think there are significant tradeoffs because part of what makes\ncharter schools great is the autonomy that they're provided and the\nprivate ingenuity that they bring.\nBut, if a state wanted to assert more control over those entities, then it\nwould be free to set up its program that way.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nAnd it would yield potentially a different result in those cases.\n### James A. Campbell:\nIt could potentially depending on how they set it up.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nThank you.",

Campbell:\nWe are not saying that at all.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nRight.\nIf you have charter schools, you can't favor religion.\nYour point is you also can't disfavor religion, correct?\n### James A. Campbell:\nThat's right.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAnd then the case that I think the Respondent relies on pretty heavily is\nWest versus Atkins, the -- the case about medical services in prison.\nCan you respond to that? Because I think that's one they put a good deal\nof emphasis on.\n### James A. Campbell:\nYeah, a couple of responses to that.\nThe first point I would emphasize is I think that outsourcing theory that\nthey're relying on is entirely foreclosed by this Court's decision in\nRendell-Baker. So, in Rendell-Baker, the question presented built in\nthat idea of outsourcing.\nIt said that the school at issue there had a duty under state law to\nprovide that education, and that's what transformed it into a state\nactor. And the dissent in that decision relied on that theory.\nBut, importantly, the majority looked at that same state law that put\nthat duty on the -- the state to provide that education and it said that in\nno way amounted to state action.\nSo I think that argument's foreclosed by Rendell -Baker. A second point\nI would make is that the state here hasn't outsourced its obligation at\nall.\nThe state continues to provide free public education to all children in the\nstate through its government -run schools. And the last point I would\nmake is a factual distinction between West and our case, and that's\nbecause West involved a situation where the plaintiff had no option.\nThe plaintiff only had one choice for the orthopedic services that he was\nseeking.\nIn this case, no one is forced to go to St. Isidore or any other charter\nschool in Oklahoma.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAnd one last question to the extent you know.\nWhat does the state oversight of private schools look like in Oklahoma\nto ensure that they meet certain standards? This is following up on\nJustice Kagan's question because that's another bucket of schools and I\nassume the state does something with private schools, but -- but what\nis that?\n### James A. Campbell:\nThe state does have some oversight, particularly when a private school\nwants to participate in one of the school funding or school choice\nprograms.\nSo Oklahoma has a tax credit program, but, in order for a school to\nparticipate in that, they need to be accredited.\nAnd so that accreditation process does involve oversight, looking into\nthe curriculum.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nWhat else -- what else does the accreditation process for private\nschools entail? If you can kind of spell that out.\n### James A. Campbell:\nYeah.\nI mean, it -- it primarily looks at the curriculum to ensure that it's\nmeeting minimum standards, to make sure that children are learning\nthe basics of reading, writing, math, et cetera.\nThere is not a lot of a focus on how the -- how the schools operate, and\nso it primarily focuses on those curriculum issues at a high level.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThank you.",

      "target_dialogue": "## Justice Jackson\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo, as I understand it, your free exercise claim relies on the Trinity\nLutheran Carson line of cases, and you've said several times here that\nthe argument is that when a state creates a public benefit, it can't tell\nreligious groups they can't participate.\nThat's sort of basic law as we understand it today.\nI guess what I'm confused about is whether what you are asking for in\nthis case really maps on to that line of analysis, and so let me explain to\nyou what I'm concerned about and then you can tell me why I'm wrong.\nSo your argument is that St. Isidore is seeking the same public benefit as\neveryone else, which is to start a charter school, but I think that actually\nmight misunderstand the public benefit in this scenario because\nOklahoma has been clear that what it wants to do is use the charter\nsystem to set up a system of secular public schools.\nThat's what the charter program does.\nThe --the contract provides money and support for private entities, and\nso we can assume, we can start where you start, we can assume this is a\nprivate entity.\nAnd Oklahoma says, fine, private entities come in, and we provide\nmoney and support if you want to establish a secular charter school in\norder to advance our goal of having that sort of system.\nImportantly, I think, we've said in Carson that they are allowed to do\nthat.\nCarson says that a state can permissibly choose \"to provide a strictly\nsecular education in its public schools.\" And so that appears to be what\nOklahoma is trying to do.\nNow, in this case, St. Isidore doesn't want to establish a secular school,\nwhich is what the public benefit is.\nInstead, they want to establish a religious school. So, as I see it, it's not\nbeing denied a benefit that everyone else gets.\nIt's being denied a benefit that no one else gets, which is the ability to\nestablish a religious public school.\nCan you explain to me why this is actually the same as Trinity Lutheran\nor Carson or whatnot?\n### James A. Campbell:\nWell, I -- I think building the secular requirement into the -- the\ndefinition of the benefit creates the same error that this Court corrected\nfrom -- that the lower court committed in Carson.\nAnd what I mean by that is the Court used the phrase, did it --it talked\nabout semantic exercises.\n### Justice Jackson:\nIt's not actually not -- it's not a semantic exercise because I do think\nthat you would have a Trinity Lutheran problem if St. Isidore's came in\nand said we would like to establish a secular public school. We want our\nschool to look exactly like all of the other charter schools that are out\nthere.\nYou're -- you're offering money to establish this kind of school, and\nhere we are.\nAnd if the state said, oh, but -- as they did in these other Trinity\nLutheran, et cetera, cases, oh, but you're religious, and we think that if\nwe give you money, that'll be an Establishment Clause violation or\nwhatnot, you would totally be an all fours with Trinity Lutheran.\nBut, here, I think what",

But this Court has not always said that\nthat's controlling for the constitutional reasons.\nIn Lebron, it was a First Amendment claim.\nThen, in the follow-on Amtrak case, you had a private nondelegation\nclaim.\nAnd in both cases, the Court said Amtrak was created by the\ngovernment and it was controlled by the government. And it\ndistinguished other instances, including U.S. Olympic, but then also the\nregional rail cases, where you even had some control at some level by\ngovernment-appointed board members.\nBut the Court said it wasn't complete control and that wasn't enough.\nSo those are the two defining features, Your Honor.",

McGinley:\nSure.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd let's come to more modern times, West, which is the issue is not\nwho's doing it but whether the government is outsourcing to that\nperson their own obligation.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nSo I have a very direct answer to you on that, and I would point you to\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWell, the problem with Rendell-Baker is that the Carolina schools\nsystem didn't claim that was a constitutional obligation.\nThey had not been educating maladjusted children ever.\nThey had just decided that they would start doing that.\nBut the Court didn't view that as a constitutional obligation.\nIt was a contract obligation but not a constitutional obligation.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nI -- I'm not sure about that, but I -- but I think, in Carson, Maine viewed\nit as a constitution -- state constitutional obligation to provide free\npublic education, and one of the ways that they did that was through\nthe program that was upheld in Carson versus Makin.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nOh, but all of those programs h ad an intermediary, someone else who\nwas making the choice, not the government. Here, the government is\nthe actual creator of the charter school because the charter school does\nnot exist without government funding.\nSo it is -- if it's not a government actor, it is still creating a religious\ninstitution.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nSo I disagree with that, Your Honor.\nI'd point you to page 157a of the Petition Appendix in our petition, which\npoint -- which is a declaration from -- called the Losnia declaration that\nto St. Isidore is if parents choose to do so.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThen we go back to who -- who defines it, the parents or the state, in\nbeing the one who says you can do what I would do.\nAll right.\nThank you, counsel.\n### Michael H.

McGinley:\nSo I just want to clarify we didn't strike out the nondiscrimination\nclause.\nThere still is the nondiscrimination clause.\nWe had agreed to abide by all applicable law.\nWhat we --what we recognize and what the State recognized in\n### Justice Kagan:\nYou modified it to incorporate various church autonomy principles.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nCorrect, but I would say, Your Honor, those are antidiscrimination\n### Justice Kagan:\nThat -- that's fine.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nSure.\n### Justice Kagan:\nIt's not the point of the question.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nSure.\n### Justice Kagan:\nAnything else? Did you strike out anything else?\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nIn terms of striking out, I -- I -- I don't believe so.\n### Justice Kagan:\nWhat if you had wanted to strike out other provisions, for example,\ncurricular provisions, because the kind of religious education that you\nthought it was your mission to provide were inconsistent with those\ncurricular requirements?\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nSo I think that would be part of the contracting process, and I do agree\nwith my friend that the framework of analysis would be very different,\nright, because, here, there's no dispute that St. Isidore qualifies for the\nprogram for all purposes other than the sectarian requirement. And so\n### Justice Kagan:\nRight.\n### Justice Kagan:\nIt involves a certain kinds of -- certain kind of exercise. So, you know,\nit's not just like you want to put the word \"Catholic\" up on the door.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nRight.\n### Justice Kagan:\nYou want to teach certain things, as would any or most religious schools.\nSo suppose a religious school came in and said, in addition to the\nmodifications that you made, we want to make some further\nmodifications with respect to the curricular requirements.\nI'll give you a hypothetical just so we can focus the inquiry.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nSure.\n### Justice Kagan:\nLet's say we're not in Oklahoma.\nLet's say we're up in New York, and there's a Hasidic community that\nhas Yeshiva, and it's a very serious Yeshiva, and what that means is that\nalmost all the instruction has to do with studying Talmud and other\nreligious texts.\nVery little of it has to do with secular subjects.\nAlmost none of the instruction is in English.\nAlmost all of it is in Yiddish or in various, like, ancient Hebrew-Aramaic\nkind of languages.\nAnd that's the charter school that this Hasidic community wanted to\nqualify for.\nDoes New York have to say yes even though those --that curriculum is\nsuper-different from the curriculum that we provide in our regular\npublic schools? Ye s, come join our -- our completely taxpayer-funded\ncharter school program?\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nSo the first thing I would say is that given the nature of charter school\nprograms, it very well might be that the state wants that or is fine with\n### Justice Kagan:\nLet's say the state is not fine with that.\nLet's say the state thinks it's great that you provide that education on\nyour own, and it might be that if we have certain kinds of tuition\nassistance, you would be included in that.\nBut the -- but -- but the state has this same idea, honestly, that\nand -- and they're supposed to sort of look like public schools, and this\none really doesn't.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nSo the first thing I would say is just the label of \"public school\" clearly\ncan't do the work.\n### Justice Kagan:\nI'm not suggesting that.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nI -- I know.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nBut -- but -- so then to the -- then you would go to a different\nframework of analysis that would be under this Court's case law that\nincludes Fulton, Smith, that line of cases that would say -- would ask all\nsorts of questions that would be highly fact-dependent, such as: Is it a\nneutral law of general applicability? To what extent does it burden the\nreligious beliefs, et cetera, et cetera? And is there a compelling interest\n### Justice Kagan:\nWell, this definitely burdens the religious beliefs.\nI mean, this is what this community thinks an education is all about, and\nthis is what this community thinks is critically important to train their\nyoung people in the tenets of their religious practice and so forth.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nSure.\nAnd so I --I can't tell you standing here today exactly how that or any\nother hypothetical case would come about.\nBut what I can tell you is that Carson and Espinoza and a whole series of\ncases, including Zelman, say you can't take imagined, hypothetic al\ndownstream questions and let them drive and justify front-end\nreligious discrimination.\n### Justice Kagan:\nWell, I don't have to imagine very hard to come up with a hundred\nhypotheticals like this because religious communities are really\ndifferent in this country and are often extremely different from secular\ncommunities in terms of the education that they think is important for\ntheir young people and it's critically important to their faith. I mean,\nnobody would say that the kind of instruction that is -- that exists in the\nkind of school that I laid out, which are -- there are many of -- is not\ncritically important to the faith and to the -- the -- the training of\nyoung people in the faith according to that community.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nSure.\nAnd that was true in Carson, and what this Court said is that when you\nopen a program to other private organizations, you have to -- you can't\nexclude the religious.\nAnd so, you know, that's how the Court dealt with it in Carson.\nThe other thing I would point out, and my friend Mr. Campbell pointed\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo a state has a -- what it considered a charter school system which\nwas, you know, basically offering a kind of education that it was familiar\nwith, that it applied curricular and testing and standards to . It wanted\nto increase curricular flexibility. It did not want to start funding every\nreligious school in the country.\nAnd now you're saying to that state, you know: Yes, you have to go fund\nthe Yeshiva that I described; yes, you have to go fund the ^ Madras; yes,\nyou have to go fund da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, if you want to\nhave this program at all.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nWell, I'm not -- I don't think I'm saying that, Your Honor.\nI'm saying there's a different, you know, framework of analysis.\nThat analysis would have to be applied.\nBut the other thing I would say is that a state doesn't have to open up an\neducational program to private organizations. That's -- the Court has\nsaid that consistently in this case law.\nAnd so no one is saying that a state is compelled to open up these\nprograms and to invite in the religious.\nWhat they're saying is that what the Free Exercise Clause says is that if\nyou do open it up, then you can't exclude the religious because they're\nreligious, neither because of their status or because of their use.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nThank you.",

McGinley:\nThat's correct.\nThat's the teaching of this Court's case law.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI don't see that that's the teaching of the case law.\nI see that whatever the program is, it has to be available to religious\npeople.\nBut what if the state says: My program is, you know, murals that are not\nreligious or schools that are not religious? That's the part that I'm really\nconfused about, because your free exercise argument is based on this\ndiscrimination principle, which I totally get, but if you're striking out\nprovisions of the contract, then it seems to me that you are not seeking\nthe same public benefit that everyone else is getting.\nThe state says: Here's our program, and we're laying out all the\nprovisions in a contract, and anyone who would like to have this\ncontract, you're welcome, and we're not excluding religious people,\nwe're not excluding any people, but here are the terms.\nAnd you say: Ah, but there's a term in here that says you have to be\nnonsectarian.\nAnd I -- I do want to point out that that term is actually in the federal\nlaw because the State of Oklahoma defines its charter school on the\nbasis of what federal law has defined as a charter school.\nIt's a public school created or adapted by a developer, private\norganization.\nAnd to qualify, the school must not charge tuition and must be\nnonsectarian in its programs, admissions, policies, employment\npractices, and all other operations.\nAnd so that's a --that's, like, what it is. And so it just seems to me very\nhard to accept the discrimination principle that you're putting forward\nwhen you come in and say: We don't want that contract.\nWe want one that we've tailored to strike out some of the terms that you\nhave put in here.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nSo, with respect, I think the --the argument you're articulating is\nprecisely the one that was rejected in Carson, which says you can't, you\nknow, define the program by saying it has to be something that's\nnonsectarian because that merely says that -- by doing so, you're\nessentially building into the definition a way to discriminate, in\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo the federal law is unconstitutional that sets up charter schools and\nincludes as a term the nonsectarian status?\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nSo I won't speak for my friend, who I think will be up here shortly, but\nmy understanding is that -- is that their view is that that particular\nterm is no longer enforceable.\nAnd I think there's an OLC opinion that essentially says as much after\nTrinity Lutheran.\n### Justice Jackson:\nWhen -- when Carson -- I -- I have to go back and take a close look at\nCarson, but were they changing the terms of the actual benefit that was\nbeing offered, or were they saying that religious people have to have\naccess to that benefit as it exists?\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nSo my understanding of the -- of Maine's law in Carson is that, like\nOklahoma's law, it had a provision that said that no sectarian institution\n### Justice Jackson:\nNo, that's the -- that's the no sectarian institution can have this\ncontract.\n### Justice Jackson:\nYeah, I agree with that.\n### Michael H. McGinley:\nRight, but you may remember that one of the critical questions in\nCarson is whether there's a status use distinction, and this Court -- you\nvery definitively said that there's not.\nAnd I think that goes directly to Your Honor's questions.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThank you.\n### Michael H.

John Sauer:\nTo -- to protect establishment interests more fiercely than the federal\nEstablishment Clause actually protects them is not a compelling state\ninterest that can take away free exercise rights.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI guess I feel like that's completely circular, and maybe I'm wrong about\nit, but I'm just trying to understand it.\nSo how does that account for a state's concern that unless they are\nsetting up a series of nonsectarian programs, they would be funding\nreligious activities in a way that the Constitution doesn't allow? I don't\ncompelling interest to prevent religious schools from doing exactly the\nsame thing as everybody else is doing in this program, but I'm actually\ndrawing a distinction, as you've heard me say before, that what the\nreligious schools are asking for here is not exactly the same thing. And\nso, to the extent that the state is saying we see a distinction between\nreligious schools, which require all of these religious rights and\nproselytize and do whatever, we see a distinction between those kinds\nof schools and public schools, and we only want to set up public schools\nbecause our compelling interest is to prevent the entanglement of the\nstate with funding those kinds of schools.\n### Justice Jackson:\nYeah.\n### Justice Jackson:\nOkay.\n### D. John Sauer:\nand independent private choice asserted in Zelman and reaffirmed in\nTrinity Lutheran, in Espinoza, and Carson.\nHere, participation in the program is mediated through two layers of\nprivate choice.\ndecide to participate, and more fundamentally, the parents decide to\nsend their kids there.\nAs both I -- I think -- both attorneys argue, they -- there is the option,\nthe backstop option, of the traditional government -run public schools.\nUnder that set of circumstances, there is, I think, not a plausible claim\nthat there is an actual direct Establishment Clause violation, so much so\nthat I believe that Respondents on this point hinge their Establishment\nClause argument entirely on their government entity argument.\nSo they, I sense, as I read it, concede that there's only an Establishment\nClause problem if these actually are government entities.\n### Justice Jackson:\nOkay.\n### D.

The\nentwinement argument, for example, they rely solely on Brentwood\nAcademy, and Brentwood Academy is a case where public officials were\n86 percent of the membership of the state athletic association, and\nthey appointed other public officials to control it.\nSo Brentwood Academy is very similar to the government-controlled\ncases like MOHELA and Amtrak, where the government's controlling\neverything.\nThere was a little private involvement to the tune of 14 percent, but\nthat's very different.\nHere, we're talking at the polar opposite of that, where every single\ndirector is privately controlled.\nAnd under the cases we cited, Cherry Cotton Mills, Bank of America -- or\nBank of United States, all the way up through Biden against Nebraska,\nit's -- the situation is the opposite of what the Court -- the Court has\nheld to be this is a governmental actor on that crucial control factor.\n### Justice Alito:\nThank you.",

John Sauer:\nto directly address that.\n### Justice Kagan:\nI mean, I've just got to think that there are religions that are going to\nhave no problems dealing with all the various curricular requirements\nand religions that are going to have very severe problems dealing with\nall the curricular requirements.\nAnd we're going to end up in a state of the world which has kind of, you\nknow, accepted establishment religions and more different, more\nfundamentalist, more, you know, use the adjective you want, religions\nthat seem peculiar to many eyes but are deeply felt.\n### D. John Sauer:\nI'd be very surprised if that were the practical outcome because I'd be\nsurprised if there were religions who want to operate essentially charter\nschools who are unwilling to, you know, agree to teach math and\nscience.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThere's a big incentive to operating charter schools since everything is\nfunded for you, I mean, so I think that there are going to be -- there's a\nline out the door if --if -- if you -- you can do this consistent with your\nreligious belief.\nAll I'm suggesting to you is this notion that the state can do this while\nstill maintaining all its various curricular requirements, I mean, either\nthat's sort of fantasy land given the state of religious belief and\nwhat's going to result is treating, shall we call them, majoritarian\nreligions very differently from minority religions.\n### D. John Sauer:\nFirst, I'd say that if there is, in fact, a line out the door, so to speak, that\nline out the door will increase the diversity of options for parents and\nstudents in states that have programs that are similar to Oklahoma.\nthe -- whatever the opposite of majoritarian is and nonmajoritarian\nreligions, I -- I --I can't speak to that.\n### Justice Kagan:\nLet me just ask you one quick last question and make sure that I\nunderstand what part of the federal statute you're giving up today.\nAs I understand it, the federal law conditions money on recipients being\npublic schools that are nonsectarian in their programs, admissions\npolicies, employment practices, and all other operations.\nSo that's the part of the federal statute that I focused on.\nAnd you're saying today that that is so patently unconstitutional that\nyou will not defend that statute.\n### D. John Sauer:\nI --I -- I would give the same qualifications I gave earlier.\nOur position today would be that programs and operations -- under the\nlogic of Carson and Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza, programs and\noperations would need a free exercise exception.\nThe government's already determined in 2020, after Trinity Lutheran,\nthat affiliation that is referred to in that statute also can't survive after\nTrinity Lutheran.\nWhen it comes to admissions policies, which is also referred to in the\nstatute, we defend that.\n### Justice Kagan:\nGot it.\nThank you.",

Garre:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three\nconsiderations distinguish this case from the Trinity Lutheran trilogy\nand require affirmance. First, charter schools are public schools.\nThey bear all the hallmarks of the criteria this Court recognized in\nCarson, are established, just like the Court said in Carson states could, to\nexpand educational opportunities within the public schools system, and\nhave been recognized as and indeed are required to be public schools by\nthe Congress of the United States and the legislatures of 47 states.\nSecond, teaching religion in -- in -- as truth in public schools is not\nallowed. St. Isidore has made clear that that's exactly what it wants to\ndo in infusing its school day with the teachings of Jesus Christ.\nOklahoma respects and promotes through vouchers and other means\nthe abilities of families to secure such an education in a private school.\nBut this Court in -- this Court has held in a series of landmark\nprecedents not challenged by anyone here that the Establishment\nClause bars such devotional teaching in public schools. And, third,\nPetitioners are not seeking access to Oklahoma's program on equals\nterms.\nThey seek a special status: the right to establish a religious charter\nschool plus an exemption from the nondiscrimination requirements\nthat apply to every other charter school and that distinguish public\nschools from private schools.\nThe charter schools movement is one of the modern -day success\nstories of public education.\nPresidents, governors, and legislators from -- from across the country\nhave recognized that charter schools have improved educational\nopportunities and outcomes for millions of Americans, especially those\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds, within the public schools system.\nA ruling for Petitioners would not only lead to the creation of the\nnation's first religious public school, it would render unconstitutional,\nas my friend from -- the Solicitor General acknowledged, the federal\ncharter school program and immediately the laws of 47 states across\nthis country, and it would result in the astounding rule that states not\nonly may but must fund and create public religious schools, an\nastounding reversal from this Court's time-honored precedents. I\nwelcome the Court's questions.",

Garre:\nOf course, Your Honor. They --they bear all the hallmarks this Court has\nrecognized.\nThey're free, open to all, funded by taxpayers, controlled by the state\nwith respect to their curriculum.\nthey're required to meet nondiscrimination laws, and they're\nnonsectarian, all the features that this Court recognized in Carson and\nhad little difficulty applying.\n### Justice Thomas:\nSo, in -- in your -- in the way you look at this case, there is no way that\nSt. Isidore can participate in the charter program and be -- and remain\nprivate?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nThat's right.\nThat's a matter -- that's not me saying it.\nIt's the state saying it.\nI mean -- and --and the Oklahoma Supreme Court made this clear.\nI mean, we've had a lot of statements that St. Isidore is a private\ninstitution and not a public school.\nI mean, what -- what the Oklahoma Supreme Court said was St. Isidore,\nI'm quoting here, \"came into existence through the charter with the\nstate and will function as a component of the state's public schools\nsystem.\" That's at page 30a of the appendix.\nThe -- the court also -- the state court also said that this is a\nlegislature-created entity.\nIt's a surrogate of the state.\nIt's a public school.\nI -- this Court has a lot of authority, but I don't think it has the authority\n### Justice Thomas:\nSo I think the argument that St. Isidore and the board has made --are\nmaking is that it's a private entity that is participating in a state\nprogram.\nIt was not created by the state program.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nRight.\nAnd state law, as interpreted by the Oklahoma Supreme Court, refutes\nthat.\nAnd I don't -- with respect, I don't think this Court can second -guess\nthat. And --and let me talk about the state law.\nI mean, to put aside what the Oklahoma Supreme Court said, state law in\n3-132.2 says that charter schools are established as an entity.\nThe Oklahoma Administrative Code 210:40 -87-5(b) says:\n\"Establishment of a new charter school.\nA new charter school is established when a charter school application is\napproved.\" And -- and there were a question about how St. Isidore has\nchanged the application here.\nI mean, it did so with respect to the nondiscrimination requirements,\nand let me quote in a couple ways.\nOn pages 295 to 96 of the Respondent appendix, in a statement of\nassurance, it said it would apply with federal and state law, \"with\npriority given to the Catholic Church's understanding of itself and its\nrights and its obligations pursuant to the Code of Canon Law and the\ncatechism of the Catholic Church.\" That's one. And then, on page 332a\nof the Respondent's appendix: The --\"The school complies with all\napplicable state and federal laws and statutes to the extent the\nteachings of the Catholic Church allow.\" And then, with respect,\nanother important change is they completely changed the definition of\npublic schools.\nIf you look at page 521a of Respondent's appendix, that's the charter\nschool template that the state provides, and it defines a public school as\na school \"established by the legislature that's free and supported by the\nstate.\" And what they described it as, at page 4a in their application of\nthe Respondent's appendix, is that charter schools are privately\noperated not-for-profit entities.\nSo that's what they're making up.\nUnder state law, just --not only Oklahoma.\nNorth Dakota just became the fortieth state in the Union to recognize\ncharter schools as public schools, as the Congress of the United States\nhas recognized this.",

How do we draw that line so\nthat we capture public schools on your account but we don't capture,\nand you seem to say we shouldn't capture, entities like Fulton? And, by\nthe way, I'm delighted to hear they're -- they're still teaching the\nproblems of dangling modifiers in Oklahoma's schools.\n(Laughter.)\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nRight.\nSo, again, Your Honor, the adoption agencies and other faith-based\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWell, they have to be incorporated, and they have to be approved, and\nsatisfy certain criteria that the state -- I mean, it's comprehensive\nregulation.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nI mean, Oklahoma has a general corporations law too, Your Honor, and\nwhat is going on in the charter school program is fundamentally\ndifferent.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWhat's the test, I guess, is what I'm asking, Mr. Garre, that you'd have\nus apply? Because, you know, we have to have a test to distinguish these\ntwo buckets of cases, right?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nRight.\nI think, first of all, here, we're dealing with public schools, and -- and I\nthink, you know, we can talk about the other examples, but, I mean, I\nthink we're dealing with public schools.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nyou've urged us to say public schools are different from other\ncontractors like Catholic Charities in Fulton, and so we need a test, a law\nIs it Lebron? Is that where you'd have us look?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nI think you can look at -- I mean, look, I think that public schools bear all\nthe hallmarks of government entities, and we can go down the list.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nthat we should be looking at? I know you say we shouldn't look at state\naction doctrine.\nI mean, is it --is it -- is it those two factors?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nI think it's those.\nI can give you the five -- the five factors that this Court looked to in\nLebron.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nOkay.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nCreation, which I think is clearly met here because the Oklahoma\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nI'll let you go through that.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nOkay.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nthis -- this decision --this distinction.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nI think this Court can decide this case by saying that charter schools or\npublic schools in all the ways that people have always recognized and\nthat this Court has recognized and that you can't fund an entity to teach\nreligion as truth in public schools.\nI also think you can look at the government entity precedents and the\nstate actor precedents and come to the same conclusion.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nPlease.\nI didn't mean to stop you.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nOkay.\nCreation.\nIn the Oklahoma Supreme Court decision in this case, Oklahoma law\nanswers that.\nThe public charter schools are created by the legislature.\nThey come into existence and they become part of the state public\nschools system.\nThat's what the Oklahoma Supreme Court said at page 30.",

Garre:\nYes.\nAnd I don't think, when this Court decided Fulton, it thought it was\nimposing new requirements on public schools . And with respect to\nsupervision and control, if I could just make one more point. Federal law\nrequires this.\nThe charter school program requires that charter schools \"be operated\nunder public supervision and direction.\" This is at 7221(i)(2)(B) of the\nstatute.\nAnd this is really important.\nI mean, the federal charter school program has been implemented for\ndecades.

And then you come in and you say, oh, we're a\nreligious school.\nIt's like, oh, no, can't do that, that's too much.\nThat's scary.

Garre:\nI mean, to the extent traditional public schools can, yes.\n### Justice Alito:\nI'll take your example of a school that focuses on music.\nSo could a school that focuses on music teach only the music composed\nby dead white men, Brahms -- Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms, and all\nthe rest? Could they do that?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nI think like a traditional public school could.\n### Justice Alito:\nAll right.\nCould a -- could a school that focuses on music say, no, we're not going\nto do that; we're going to include jazz and hip-hop and rap and music\nfrom non-European countries? Could they do that?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nI think they probably could do that.\n### Justice Alito:\nAll right.\nCould a school say we're going to be a LG -- LGBTQ-plus friendly school\nso that the books that elementary schoolchildren are going to read are\ngoing to have lots of LGBTQ-plus characters, same-sex couples, and\nthey are going to send the message that this is a perfectly legitimate\nlifestyle? They're going to tell the little kids, if you --your parents may\nsay you're a boy or a girl, but that doesn't mean you really are a boy or a\ngirl.\nCould they do that?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nAnd the reason why they couldn't is because state law prohibits the\nteaching of gender studies or race in public schools, traditional public\nschools and charter schools.\n### Justice Alito:\nAll right.\nI'll give you another example.\nCould a school say we're a progressive school and we're going to do\neverything the state wants you to do, but we're going to teach history\nfrom the 1619 Project standpoint.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nNo, because they'd have to meet the state's academic standards, and\n### Justice Alito:\nWhy would that not be --why would not be -- that not be allowed?\nWe're going to put a lot of -- we're going to make sure students know\nabout -- know a lot about slavery and Jim Crow and the treatment of\nNative Americans.\n### Justice Alito:\nThey can't do that?\n### Justice Alito:\nThey can't -- they can't emphasize that?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nJust like a traditional public school, there would be some leeway there,\nbut, with respect, they could -- certainly couldn't set --focus their\ncurriculum just on that.\nAnd -- and --and let me give you the citation so you can look at the\nacademic standards.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, on the other hand, I don't want this to be one -sided.\nSo suppose a school says we're going to teach American history like the\nway it was taught in 1955, so we're going to celebrate the founding\nfathers and we're not going to say anything about their short -- their\nshortcomings and we're not going to make --we're not going to say a\nwhole lot about the -- the dark episodes in American history.\nCould they do that?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nTraditional Oklahoma public schools could not do that and charter\n### Justice Alito:\nWhere does it say that?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nSo it says it in -- 3-34(B)(12) of the charter schools statute says that\ncurriculum must be aligned with state academic standards.\nAnd then, if you go to Oklahoma Administrative Code 210:15-3-1, it\nspells out in detail the criteria for curriculum.\nAnd we've got other cites in our brief on that.\nAnd -- and they're controlled in the same way that public schools are.\nAnd that's the point,\n### Justice Alito:\n.\nCharter schools are like public schools, traditional public schools. When\nit comes to curriculum, they're controlled as to curriculum.\nAnd that completely distinguishes private schools.\nMy friend had -- was asked how are private schools different.\nI think his answer left a lot to be desired here on that, and -- and let me\njust walk --walk through how they're different,",

I mean, private schools are fundamentally\ndifferent.\nWhat we're talking about here is a school that is closely regulated that is\npart of the public schools system.\nAnd this Court, again, in Carson said that states can expand their public\nschools.\nThat's what charter schools are.\nThey were meant to expand the public school options for families across\nthe country, and they've been successful, especially for families from\ndisadvantaged backgrounds.\nAnd if this Court holds that the Oklahoma program is unconstitutional,\nthen it immediately renders the charter school laws in 47 states\nWell, that -- that's a little bit -- this would be expanding the options,\nnot contracting the options.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nWell, why not?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nBecause charter schools were built on the premise that they're public\nschools, and that was by design because people wanted to expand\naccess to public schools and people understand that religion cannot be\ntaught.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nI thought they were built on the idea that innovative -- innovative\napproaches to education would increase the quality of education in a\nparticular community or at least provide options for particular focuses\nand -- and overall improve the educational quality in the state.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nYou don't have to believe me.\nYou can just look at the fact that Congress from the beginning of the\nfederal charter school program in 1994 and every single state has made\nclear that charter schools are to be public schools and run as public\nschools.\nAnd that's the way it's always been understood.\nAnd -- and if this Court rules in favor of Petitioners here, there are going\nto be some states that ramp it up, no question, but there are going to be\nother states that say we want out.\nAnd, you know, each state can make its own decision.\nBut this is going to have a dramatic effect on charter schools across the\ncountry. And just think of the federal charter school program on its own.\nI don't think -- you can't just say, like, oh, we'll just, you know, grant a -\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nWell, it's not going to --that would -- the premise of that was that at\nthat point, it was considered constitutional to discriminate against\nreligious entities and that, you know, that's -- some of our case law has\nchanged that and said no, it's not constitutional to discriminate against\nprivate religions.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAnd you'll probably disagree with my characterization there.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nI encourage you to read the OLC opinion because what that opinion says\nis it focuses on the affiliation requirement, that you could have a school\nthat potentially is a religious entity, wants to run a secular program, and\nthat that wouldn't be allowed.\nThe OLC opinion itself goes --goes out of its way to make clear that it\nwasn't saying that you could have charter schools running religious\nprograms.\nAnd I think it's obvious that the result would be different there because\nof the Establishment Clause problems.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nClause.\nBut the use distinction, of course, makes a difference with respect to the\nEstablishment Clause.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nIn terms of the principles, how is it different from a choice program in\nthe -- in the sense that no student is compelled to go to a religious\ncharter school? And I would, of course, agree with you, you know, if that\nwere the case, that would be a huge problem.\nNo one's compelled to go.\nYou have a choice to go to the traditional public school, or you can go to a\ncharter school of your choice that you can obtain admittance to, or you\ncan go to a private school.\nNo one's being compelled to go to any school.\nIt's just another option that is available.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nThat's right.\nAnd this Court had a case last week in Mahmoud where it involved, you\nknow, story time with certain offensive messaging.\nNo parent was required to send their child to that charter school, and I\ndon't think that case would come out differently -- to that public school\nbecause I don't think it would come out differently because they could\nhave picked a charter school.\nAnd, similarly, no -- no -- no family in America has to send their kid to a\ntraditional public school.\nThey could send them to a private school.\nThey could home-school them.\nThey could send them --you know, other options.\nBut this Court has never said that because you have the option of not\nsending your child to a traditional public school, public schools can\nteach religion as truth.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nWell, that's loading traditional public school into this, but I -- I get the -\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nNo, I'm just taking your --the premise of your question is what's the\nproblem, you have the option of going to a different school, and that's -\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nNo, it's the option -- you have a public school to go to, and you have\nprivate schools to go to, and you have charter schools to pick from.\nYou may not like the environmental studies one, but you have other\noptions.\nAnd this increases the options at least theoretically.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nPeople can choose among public schools as well.\nYou can transfer among public schools if -- if the teaching in that school\nis offensive to you.\nthere was a suggestion in the brief here that those cases are different\nbecause you were compelled to go to a public school.\nThat's wrong. Compulsory attendance laws since this Court's decision\nin Pierce have not applied to students --parents who want to send their\nchildren to private schools or home-school them. So everyone has a\nchoice in that respect.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThe -- the -- the other options in the Mahmoud were not free, okay, so\nthat's a big difference.\nIt was telling the parents there, oh, don't go to the public school if you\ndon't like it; go pay $10,000.\nWell, that's a pretty big burden.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nWell, I don't think Mahmoud would come out differently if you had -- in\njurisdictions where parents had the option to send them to a charter\nschool, Your Honor. Maybe the Court will say otherwise, but I doubt it.",

Garre:\nWell, it went rogue, Your Honor.\nThe membership of the board was changed.\nInitially there was a resistance to granting this -- this application,\nbecause it flouted Oklahoma law.\nAnd there was a change in the board that -- that we challenged, you\nknow, right on the eve of a second vote, and -- and the charter was\npassed 3-2.

Garre:\nWell, we can all read it. And I'll quote it. \"St. Isidore came into existence\nto the charter system with the\" -- \"with the state and will function as a\ncomponent of the state's public school system.\" That's at page 38.\nI don't think there's any ambiguity there.",

So these are not extemporaneous\ncomments. \"While many Oklahomans undoubtedly support charter\nschools sponsored by various Christian faiths, the precedent created by\napproval of the application will compel approval of similar applications\nby all faiths.\nI doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a\nreligious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own.\"\nAnd this is not an isolated statement. There are -- are many.\n### Justice Alito:\nIsn't that a master -- isn't that a very serious Masterpiece Cakeshop\nproblem? This whole position that you're defending seems to be\nmotivated by hostility toward particular religions.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nThat's -- that's entirely incorrect, Your Honor.\nAnd if I could answer that in two different levels.\nOne, the Masterpiece Cake piece and, two, the comments which I'll\nbegin with.\nAnd I think the right way to understand those comments is the attorney\ngeneral was simply making a point that members of this Court have\nmade, which is that once you open up government programs and bring\npeople in to becoming part of the government, and approve one\nreligion, not another religion, or this religion, there's going to be strife\nthat comes from that.\nI mean, Justice Breyer emphasized that in his various opinions.\nThey didn't carry the day from this Court, but I think that that is a way\nthat in the real world religious divisions and -- and strife have\nmanifested itself.\nIt's, frankly, one of the reasons why we have a religion clause in the\nConstitution to begin with.\n### Justice Alito:\nDon't we have -- we have statement after statement by the attorney\ngeneral that reeks of hostility towards Islam. And then we have the\nprovision of the Oklahoma constitution, on which the Oklahoma\nSupreme Court relied, that has its own unsavory discriminatory history.\nWould you at least agree with that?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nAbsolutely not.\n### Justice Alito:\nAbsolutely not? That wasn't motivated by the Blaine movement?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nNo, it wasn't, Your Honor. And --and members of the Oklahoma\nSupreme Court has explained that.\nThe brief from the legal historians explains that.\nIt was motivated by clause --by clauses that predated the Blaine\namendments, as well as motivated by the Sequoyah Constitution and\nthe results of the Christianization of Americans.\nThat's all laid out historically.\nThis case, too --Oklahoma came into the union in 1906, and -- and the\nprovision you're referring to is 1907, which is, you know, long after the\nBlaine amendments and the Montana constitution.\nSo no, it's not a Blaine Amendment.\n### Justice Alito:\nI think you're rewriting history.\nDo you think that anti-Catholic bigotry had disappeared from\nOklahoma by 1907, or, what's more pertinent, from the Congress of the\nUnited States from 1907?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nI think, Your Honor, of course there were those who held that distasteful\nand odious bigotry, but the laws that the Oklahoma constitution\nprovision is based on long predated that.\nAnd I don't think that the Court could treat any prohibition on funding\nthat's similar as simply motivated by bigotry, and so we're not going to\nrespect it.\nIf you did, then I think, you know, frankly, the Establishment Clause\njurisprudence with respect to public schools would come tumbling\ndown.\nAnd -- and I think as to the Masterpiece case, I just want to make this\nclear, the attorney general was not involved in the creation of the\ncharter school system.\nHe wasn't involved in the application in this case. So there's no\nMasterpiece component.\nIn fact, the application was approved.\nAnd I think if --if your concern is the treatment of Islam or Muslims,\nthen the concern should be the Muslim family whose only practical\noption is the religious charter school that happens to teach the Catholic\nfaith as truth.\n### Justice Alito:\nWhy would that be -- why would that be the only option of such a\nparent? The parent could always send his or her child to the schools that\nyou characterize as the public schools.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nSo first of all, there are jurisdictions in the country, New Orleans being\nthe main one, where the only public schools are -- are charter schools.\nIn other jurisdictions it's 50 percent, Denver and D.C.\nThere are jurisdictions in Oklahoma where your default public school\nthat you're assigned to is a charter school.\nYou can get out of that, but you've got to raise your hand and say: No, I\ndon't want to go to the Catholic charter school.\nI want to go somewhere else.\nAnd that raises the same problem as raising your hand in the public\nschool and saying: No, I don't want to participate in prayer today.\n### Justice Alito:\nThank you, Mr. Garre.\n### Justice Alito:\nI just have one more question.\nI will -- I will study the record carefully, but, boy, the way that you\nthe virtue of the charter schools are.\nI thought the whole point of charter schools what was to offer\nsomething different from the so-called public schools.\nAnd you've made it sound like, no, they're just going to be exactly like\nthe public schools.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nNo, that's not our position, Your Honor.\nAnd I think, you know, again, what the states are trying to do is to\nharness ingenuity in terms of teaching, teaching methods, and you\ncome do the application and say we want to run a charter school like\nthis: language, performing arts, sports -focused, or whatnot.\nBut at that point, there's a rigorous application process.\nCurriculum is scrutinized. You have to meet state standards.\nAnd then charter schools are regulated extensively, every year\nevaluated.\nAnd they can be closed if they get off the rails, because they are public\nschools.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, do you have inspectors who say we want to see the teaching plan\nfor the 10th grade English class in the charter school, because we want\nto make sure that the books that the students are reading are the right\nbooks? Do you do that?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nThey --they can be, Your Honor.\n### Justice Alito:\nReally?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nI mean, if you look at pages 18 and 19 of the Oklahoma Supreme Court's\ndecision, it talks about how charter schools are audited.\nAgain, charter school --members of the charter school board\nparticipate in governing board meetings.\nAnd you look at those academic standards that they have to be aligned\nwith, and -- and it goes down to the -- the level of dangling modifiers in\n9th grade English class.\n### Justice Alito:\nAll right.\nThank you.",

Garre:\nThat's exactly right.\nAnd -- and -- and I want to correct one thing that my friend in terms of\ndiscussing Rendell-Baker versus West.\nWest came after Rendell-Baker.\nSo Rendell-Baker didn't resolve anything or correct anything that West\nheld.\nAnd West, as this Court recognized in the Haaland case just recently,\nrecognized that we were outsourcing constitutional functions, and here\non top of that, you have an exclusive and traditional state function,\nwhich is the function of providing public --free public education open to\nall.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThank you.",

What kind of issues would\nthey have to confront in the future? What do you think the range of\nchoices they would make is likely to be?\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nFirst, every charter school law and the federal charter school program is\nunconstitutional because they all require that charter schools be public\nschools and that they be nonsectarian.\nSo we're dealing with the confusion and uncertainty that's created by\nthat to begin with.\nStates may react differently.\nSome may reenact charter schools under the -- the details this --this\nCourt might lay -- lay out as to how to legislate.\nOr, you know, many schools will just be -- will just say, you know, no,\nwith respect, in our state, our -- our traditions are not to allow the\nteaching of religion in our public schools.\nWe don't know. This is going to create uncertainty, confusion, and\ndisruption for, you know, potentially millions of school children and\nfamilies across the country.\nThere's another piece to this, which is that under federal law, the IDEA\nstatute, charter schools are covered because they're understood to be\npublic schools.\nIf this Court holds that charter schools are not public schools, then\nthere's a question as to whether children with disabilities who go to\ncharter schools would be covered by the IDEA.\nAnd that's another problem that will have to be sorted out.\nIn terms of litigation, you will get litigation over who can be admitted.\nThey say they'll take all -comers.\nSurely, there'll be schools that want to test the next limit.\nThere will be questions about who can be teaches.\nCan you have a gay teacher or not? There will be questions about the\napplication of the ministerial exception.\nAnd then there are going to be questions about curriculum.\nThis Court is going to be superintending curriculum.\nYou know, maybe they would go too far in saying you can't -- you can't\nteach evolution; you have to teach creationism.\nBut there are going to be a lot of line-drawing problems in between.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.",

Garre:\nWell, I think the -- I mean, I think the state action question, it's\nimportant to understand that this Court has always considered state\naction with respect to the --the conduct being challenged.\nAnd here the conduct, to the extent it's relevant, is the very existence of\nthe school.\nAnd there's no question the state regulates that.\nIt can't come into existence without the state.\nAnd as to the -- the single-sex, I mean, I don't think that's a hard issue\nfor -- for the -- the State of Oklahoma.\nI don't think that that would be unconstitutional.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAnd your comment about strife, I just want to explore that for a second,\nbecause it seems like strife could also come when people who are\nreligious feel like they're being excluded because they're religious,\nwhether it's the Muslim family who is aware of the comments that were\nmade here, or the Catholic school group that says, gee, we just want to\nhave a charter school like --like the environmental group and the\nChinese immersion group and this math group.\nAnd I think you're missing a portion of the country when you say strife\nwould not result from that kind of outcome.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nWell, I think if the rule is that charter schools are public -- are -- are\npublic schools and just like traditional public schools, they -- you\ncannot have the teaching of religion as truth in charter schools, I don't\nthink that would create any new strife because that's the regime that\nwe've lived in for -- for decades.\nThe strife that I'm referring to is the picking and choosing that is\ninevitably going to occur when people line up to become, you know, a\nfully funded charter school.\nAnd so I -- I think it's -- it's quite different.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAnd then last, we've covered this a bit, but I just want to make sure I\nhave it nailed down.\nIf you prevail in this case, the senior homes, food banks, hospitals that\nparticipate -- receive government funding, participate in government\nprograms, like a foster care program, they would not become state\nactors because -- can you succinctly --or maybe just we would have a -\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nYes.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nYeah.\n### Gregory G. Garre:\nI mean, I think this Court's own precedents recognized that public\nschools are different in important ways.\nBut on your question, I mean, they're not outsourcing constitutional\nobligations.\nThere's no constitutional obligation of governments that I'm aware of,\nstates that I'm aware of, to provide adoption services or the like.\nIt's not a traditional exclusive function.\nIn Justice Alito's opinion in Fulton went to great lengths to say that\nadoption services were not a traditional or exclusive public function.\nAnd so I think that the -- the -- the government contractor scenario, I\nmean, that's what they try to bait this Court with concerns, but the\ngovernment contractors are completely different.\nThey're not created by the state in the way that the charter schools are.\nThey're not fully funded by the state.\nThey're not controlled by the state in the way that charter schools are.\nIt's an easy distinction.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThank you.",

Those -- those parents don't have to be in the\npublic school we're providing strictly secular public school column.\nThey can ask the state and they do get vouchers for religious public --I\nmean religious private schools; is that right?\n### Gregory G.
