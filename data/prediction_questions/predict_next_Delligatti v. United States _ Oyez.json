  "background": "Cornell University administered two retirement plans for its employees: the Retirement Plan and the TDA Plan. As of 2016, these defined-contribution plans had over 30,000 participants and nearly $3.4 billion in combined net assets. Cornell delegated administrative responsibilities to its Vice President for Human Resources and established the Retirement Plan Oversight Committee (RPOC) to oversee the plans. The plans offered approximately 300 investment options and incurred investment management and recordkeeping fees, with TIAA-CREF and Fidelity Investments serving as both investment providers and recordkeepers. Plaintiffs, representing a class of plan beneficiaries, sued Cornell and its appointed fiduciaries in federal district court, alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), including failure to adequately monitor the plans, resulting in the retention of underperforming investment options and excessive fees, as well as engaging in prohibited transactions under 29 U.S.C. § 1106. The district court dismissed or granted summary judgment to the defendants on most claims, and the parties reached a settlement on the remaining claim before the court entered final judgment. The plaintiffs challenged the district court’s award of summary judgment on two counts, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the lower court.",

Similarly, there's no violent force in a gentle push of a\n90-year-old down the stairs.\nYou could probably do it with a finger.\nSo there's no violent force there.\nWhat you seem to be saying is, if I have a duty to act and I choose not to,\nI'm not responsible for the force that I let work on this human being?\nThat's your position, correct?\n### Allon Kedem:\nNo, Your Honor.\nSo, in both the poisoning example and giving a gentle push to someone\nwho falls down the stairs or off of a cliff, you are not directly applying\nviolent physical force.\nIt's a gentle touch or you're just letting the molecules of the poison fall\nfrom your hand.\nBut there is still an application of violent physical force when they hit\nthe ground at high speed.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWell, I --I would tell someone who's freezing in the snow that there's an\napplication of winter conditions to their body to kill them.\n### Allon Kedem:\nSure.\nAnd in that instance, again, you might describe the elements as\ninvolved -- involving violent physical force, which perhaps you could\ndescribe as using indirectly if, for instance, you throw them out into the\nsnow.

And in a situation where, for\ninstance, you just don't provide medicine or nutrition to someone and\nthey slowly expire, there is no violent physical force of any sort.\nIt's not like hitting the ground at high speed.\nAnd, moreover, you haven't taken any step to actively employ any force.",

Would that in your\nview fall within the government's understanding of what would qualify\nas -- as the application of violent force?\n### Allon Kedem:\nIt would have to.\nThe government's view essentially is anytime you have a bad result, you\nknow that there must have been violent physical force, which means\nthat not only would the death or other injury in your example be violent\nphysical force, it would also be involved in literally every death since the\nbeginning of time because, in every death, something bad happens\nbecause you either are injured or run out of the cellular inputs necessary\nto sustain life.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nAnd if I might just ask a slightly different question.\nThis is one that --yeah, I don't know of any more powerful force in the\nuniverse than gravity, but any -- I wonder whether this statute is\ndivisible between acts and omissions, and that isn't something either\nside explored.\n### Allon Kedem:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nI know it won't help your client, okay, but perhaps -- I'd welcome your\n### Allon Kedem:\nSure.\n### Allon Kedem:\nSo this statute is not. We have opinions from the court of appeals, New\nYork's highest court, saying that the statute can be committed either by\naffirmative acts or by omissions, including pure omissions.\nSo we have the Wong case, where there were two caregivers, one of\nwhom shook the child, the other of whom failed to render aid.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nYes.\n### Allon Kedem:\nSure.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nthen the failure to fulfill it.\n### Allon Kedem:\nThat's right.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nVery different than killing somebody or ordering a hit on somebody by\nact.\nI mean, giving them a pistol in a brown paper bag is a little different.\n### Allon Kedem:\nIt is.\nPresumably, if the government thought that this statute was divisible,\nthey would have argued it, but I think your question really highlights an\nimportant point, which is it just so happens that this murder statute can\nbe satisfied either by acts or omissions.\nBut the government's argument would have to be the same even if New\nYork had a murder -by-omission statute that could only be satisfied by\na pure omission in which there was no actus reus whatsoever, other than\njust having a duty that you failed to satisfy.\nAnd the government's argument would have to be, in every single\ninstance of that murder -by -omission statute, violent physical force\nwas involved.",

Instead, what it said is we want you to look at whether\ntheir element of the offense involved the use of violent physical force\nbecause, again, if you add a gun to that sort of offense --so a robbery\noffense, for instance, robbery is obviously dangerous enough, but when\nyou add a gun to the mix, the danger go es up exponentially.\nIt changes the character.\nThe same is not true for an omission offense.\nObviously, omission offenses can be horrible and can be punished\nseverely, but you don't change anything about it when you add a gun,\nand so it's not the sort of armed career criminal behavior that Congress\nwas aimed at.",

I mean, you -- you talk\nabout at least some of the legislative history for the Criminal Code\nReform Act in 1981, and I was struck by a particular example in a report\nthat Congress -- the Senate report, where the report talks about a dam\noperator who threatens to refuse to open the floodgates during a flood\nand thereby places residents' lives in jeopardy. And the report says,\n\"Assuming the operator had some legal duty to act, his threat would be\nto engage in unlawful conduct dangerous to human life, which is not a\ncrime of violence since he did not use or threaten to use physical force.\"\nSo it seems as though we had examples in the record that Congress was\naware of omission and made pretty clear that when you don't act, you\nknow, you're not threatening to use physical force in the way that they\nintended.\n### Allon Kedem:\nThat's correct.\nIt's remarkably specific.\nAnd I understand that not all members of the Court are taken with\nlegislative history, but we can rely on it just as a sort of\ncontemporaneous use of the relevant terms in context.\nOne of the most remarkable things about the government's brief is that\nthey haven't identified a single instance, and they looked high and low,\nboth in published opinions and al so in news articles.\nEvery single one of their examples was someone who had used\nsomething actively, not passively, not the sort of passive benefit theory.\nThey were described as, for instance, NASA using the moon's\ngravitational field by shooting a rocket up into space and then aiming\ntheir satellite at the right point to make contact with the moon's\ngravitational field.\nThis idea that you can use something just by passively benefiting from\nit, the government wasn't able to identify a single real-world instance\nof it, in contrast to the one that you --you've just identified, Your\nHonor.",

So it's -- it's an actus reus interpretation of the word\n\"use.\" Then that was ported over to an Elements Clause in Leocal and\nthen again in Borden.\nAnd you're right that Leocal and Borden were both about the mental\nstate.\nBut they adopted wholesale the active employment sense of use, and\nthat active employment sense came from what Bailey said was the\nordinary meaning of the term.\nSo, unless somehow they ported over just the mental state part of active\nemployment, even though mental state wasn't at issue in Bailey, then I\nthink you bring the whole thing along with it.",

I mean, you're saying she uses physical\nforce, and that means no action but an intention that this victim\nsuccumb to a harm that she didn't put into place, that she had really\nnothing to do with, but she sees it happening?\n### Eric J. Feigin:\nSo, Your Honor, she is using physical force against the person of another\nbecause, again, she could stop it, she is legally required to stop it, and\nshe doesn't stop it because she wants the victim to die.\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo it's her -- it's only her mental state that is doing the work of her\nusing physical force?\n### Eric J. Feigin:\nNo, Your Honor.\nIt's the combination of those things.\nUnder just a plain dictionary definition of \"use,\" she has availed herself\nof the force, she has had enjoyment of the force, she's made the force\nthe --her instrument to accomplish her purpose.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAll right.\nLet me ask you about the other parts of the statute, the attempt and\nthreaten.\nSame situation. How does it work in an omission case for this lifeguard\nto threaten the -- the -- the -- the use of physical force against this\nkid? Is it because she says something to him that would make it a\nthreat? Like, I don't understand how omission works with respect to the\nrest of the statute.\n### Eric J. Feigin:\nWell, Your Honor, I -- if I could depart from the lifeguard example,\n### Justice Jackson:\nNo, no, I want the lifeguard example.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI -- I -- I want to ask you -- I want to ask you: In the lifeguard example,\nif she says, hey, kid, if you get into the water but can't swim or start to\ndrown, I'm not coming to get you, is that a threat of use of physical force\nin your view? Or how else would you accomplish the threat part of this?\n### Eric J. Feigin:\nWell, two points, Your Honor.\nNumber one, I think, if that were generally considered a threat for\npurposes of the substantive statute that the person also has to violate\nunder state or federal law, then perhaps that would be the threatened\nuse of force.\nBut it's easy to see threatened use of force in omission cases in other\nexamples.\nSuppose you're the caretaker for an old, sickly man, and you tell him:\nLook, I'm not going to give you your medicine today, and you're going to\ndie unless you give me a -- the combination to that safe over there,\nwhere you keep all your gold bars.\nThat is threatening an omission.\nI think everyone would consider that threatening an omission.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut is it a violent\n### Justice Jackson:\nGorsuch, I thought, was making before, that you may have culpable\nconduct under the law, but what we're looking for for the purpose of this\nenhancement is violent conduct, violent criminal conduct. And I guess\nwhat I'm worried about is the government's interpretation that has,\nyou know, lifeguards and caregivers and people who very intentionally\nand perhaps even criminally withhold their duties actually being put in\nthe bucket of violence even though they don't act.\n### Eric J. Feigin:\nWell, Your Honor, if you look at page 550 of the Court's decision in\nStokeling, you'll see one dictionary definition of \"violence\" that defines\nit in terms of the causation of physical harm.\nAnd in these cases -- I mean, let's not lose sight of it -- someone is\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut they're not using, Mr. Feigin.\nI mean, that's my --my problem is I don't understand how you get use\nto inaction, how you get use out of inaction.\n### Eric J. Feigin:\nSo, Your Honor, maybe a few examples.\nHe accuses us of having no examples.\nI think, if you look at our brief, you'll see a number of them.\nBut let me give you an example that comes basically straight from one\nof this Court's own opinions, which is let's take a look at the Borden\nplurality again.\nThe Borden plurality has an example of use of physical force against the\nperson of another when someone is driving a car, sees someone come in\nthe plurality's words, plowing ahead and hits them.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAction.\nAction. They're moving, right?\n### Eric J. Feigin:\nWell, Your Honor, I -- this is all just a game of -- I --I -- I think this is\nwhat one might describe as just sort of a terminological word game.",

Feigin:\nI think it's an ordinary meaning that's informed by the common law.\nSo, Your Honor, to the ordinary meaning point, on the Borden plurality\nexample, I could easily describe that conduct as simply omitting to hit\nthe brakes or omitting to turn the steering wheel.\n### Justice Kagan:\nAnd then we'd say you're playing word games, I mean, because I think,\nwhen you push your foot on the accelerator and drive your car into\nsomebody, that's not really such a hard case.\n### Justice Kagan:\nBut some of these are hard cases, like the lifeguard example, where we\nwould say, you know, the lifeguard is just sitting there, and this is not\nlike what a normal person would think of as a use of physical force.\nSo it's almost as though we have to pick our absurdity.\nYou started with one absurdity.\nWe would say that murder is not a crime of violence.\nThat seems pretty absurd. But here's another absurdity.\nThe lifeguard is just sitting up there watching somebody, is using\nphysical force.\nThat seems pretty weird too.\n### Eric J. Feigin:\nSo, Your Honor, I think your two questions, as Your Honor probably\nrecognizes, really pair together here.\nAnd the reason that we have two millennia of law that don't draw this\ndistinction is precisely because it is a word game.\nIf you look at, for example, the Hall -- the Hall treatise that we cite,\nthat's from 1960 but still substantially predates the ACCA, or you even\nwant to go further back and you look at the 1875 Wharton treatise,\nyou'll see that the Wharton treatise, for example, in Section 72 says\neven sleeping can be an affirmativ e act and it can lead to liability when\nthere's something you're supposed to be doing but you're not doing it.\nAnd the common law sources that we cite, both Hall and Territory\nagainst Manton, which is an 1888 case, have no trouble describing those\nkinds of omission cases as involving the use of force.",

Feigin:\nAnd then, finally -- I'm sorry.\n### Justice Jackson:\nOh, go ahead.\nGo ahead.\nSorry.\n### Eric J. Feigin:\nAnd then, finally, I just wanted to point out that Section 922(g)(9), the\ndefinition doesn't appear there.\nThat's in Section 921.33(a).\nThe definition of \"misdemeanor, crime of domestic violence,\" doesn't\neven have a Residual Clause.\nAnd if you look at the appendix we submitted in Voisine, most of the\nassault statutes the Court was worried about there are defined in terms\nof causation of harm or causation of offense of touching.\nI thank you for your indulgence,\n### Justice Jackson:\n.\nYes.\nNo, Mr. Feigin, I -- I appreciate that somebody died here and that we\nwould ordinarily think of murder in that situation.\nBut it's clear that the language of this provision of the statute is not\nfocused on the outcome or the effect. And I think the common-sense\nreading of this that cuts against you is the fact that \"physical force\" has\na common-sense meaning, \"use\" has a common-sense meaning and\nthat it suggests that the defendant has to act, that they have to do\nsomething.\nAnd so Justice Gorsuch's point is -- about divisibility is kind of my\nthought, which is, at the beginning of this, it seems like we have a\nbifurcation of Congress's view that you have action by a defendant and\nyou have omission in a different column, and we're sort of in the realm\nof action.\nSo I guess my question is, how could Congress have possibly written the\nwords \"use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\" and\nmeant that the defendant doesn't have to do anything at all?\n### Eric J. Feigin:\nWell, Your Honor, the -- this goes back to the common-law backdrop\nagainst when --and I -- I think the easiest way to see that, that there's\nsome linguistic ways to see that to the dictionary definitions.\n### Justice Jackson:\nNo, I'm just looking at the text of the statute.\nIf you're right -- if you're right that what Congress was trying to\ncapture with this is a defendant -- a --a -- a victim dying or a person\nbeing bodily -- you know, injured bodily, Congress has said that many\nother places, even in this very statute, when that was the triggering\nthing.\nWhat I'm worried about is interpreting the words \"use, attempted use,\nand threatened use of physical force\" to encompass a situation in which\na person is not acting.\nThat seems completely counterintuitive.\nIt seems like it has no bearing in the words of the statute.\nI've already talked with -- with -- with your friend on the other side\nabout the legislative history that actually shows that Congress wasn't\ntalking about omissions, but how -- how do you get past this sort of\nconceptual concern that we're really talking about doing something\nhere and you're suggesting that you don't have to?\n### Eric J. Feigin:\nWell, Your Honor, if I could respond, I would have, like, three principal\n### Justice Jackson:\nYes.\n### Eric J. Feigin:\nargument -- not argument -- the premise of your question was that\nthis statute doesn't look at results.\nBut I'd respectfully point the Court to Castleman and as well as Justice\nScalia's current -- concurrence in Castleman, which both point out that\nwhere you have -- where you actually have physical injury, it must have\nbeen caused by physical force.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut Castleman was -- Castleman -- Castleman was dealing with a\ndifferent question, like how much force? What is force? Is -- is putting\nthe -- the --the poison in the drink enough to be physical force? I'm\ntalking about a situation in which a person does nothing.\n### Eric J. Feigin:\nOkay.\nThe second point I'd make, Your Honor, and I've been trying to make it\nthis morning, and I take as part of your question you've kind of rejected\nthis, but I do think it fits squarely within the dictionary definitions.\nmy enemy walk in front of me and I let the car keep going and just don't\ndo anything, I think we'd all say I used physical force.\nNow maybe I got in the car and turned the key and started the car, but I\ncertainly didn't have the intent to use physical force against the person\nof another.\nI only had it at the point I stopped doing something.",

Starting first with divisibility, when this Court\nhas asked whether a statute is divisible for purposes of the categorical\napproach, it is asking whether it is linguistically divisible, whether the\ntext of the statute allows it to be divided into separate offenses.\nSometimes there are a list of different ways of committing an offense.\nSometimes they are different offenses.\nSo you could say that it involve -- burglary involves breaking into a\nhouse or a houseboat or whatever, and then the question is, is house a\ndifferent crime than houseboat? But it has to be linguistically divisible.\nYou don't look at -- and you can look at state, common law, or\notherwise to figure out whether those are different elements or means,\nbut you don't look at -- at --at case law generally to ask whether\nomissions are different offenses than not.\nThat is what my friend is asking you to do, something this Court has\nnever done.\nAnd, at minimum, if you're going to start to engage in that kind of\ndivisibility in an entirely new realm, I would think that you'd want a case\nwhere that issue had been raised and briefed.\nMy friend also said that essentially the only question about whether all\nthe statutes in its appendix are out is a question about divisibility.\nWe respectfully disagree.\nStates can agree with the general principle, as I think all of them do, that\nomissions can sometimes be liable.\nThey can accept the common-law principle but still believe that certain\nspecific offenses cannot be committed except by affirmative acts.\nWe have cases in our brief, in our reply brief, in, for instance, Louisiana,\nwhich accepts the general principle but nevertheless says that felony\nmurder cannot be committed except by an affirmative act because it is\nwritten in a way that requires a killing.\nAnd so you have a number of those statutes even in those effective\nstates that wouldn't necessarily be excluded.\nGoing to the Residual Clause, the Residual Clause is a natural home for\noffenses like murder not because murder isn't always bad but precisely\nbecause it is usually bad.\nIn other words, the vast majority of murders are, in fact, violent, which is\nwhy it makes sense to fall under a clause that talks about the risk in an\nordinary case that physical force against another will be used during the\ncourse of commission.\nIt allows for these sorts of edge cases, the difficult hypotheticals that\nwe've been talking about.\nThe Elements Clause is not written that way.\nIt requires the use of violent physical force as an element, which means\nin absolutely every case.\nAnd my friend does not dispute that there is no interpretive significance\nto the fact that the Residual Clause is no --no longer operative. Going to\nthe word \"use,\" my friend says that \"use\" derives some meaning from\nthe common law.\nThis Court in Bailey said \"use\" must be given its ordinary meaning,\nwhich is active employment.\nAnd you notice that when my friend started talking about using things\nlike metabolism or the body's natural processes, he lapsed into this sort\nof abstract concept speak rather than talking about something physical,\nlike physical force that you use against the person of another.\nCastleman.\nCastleman examples are all indirect force, poison, pulling the trigger of\na gun, introducing a disease, by which I think the Court meant, if you\ninfect someone with the Ebola virus, obviously, that's an indirect use of\nviolent physical force.\nBut they're all taking steps to bring someone into contact with the\nthing, without which, without the step you take to bring them into\ncontact with it, there would be no harm whatsoever.\nSo it's not a word game.\nWhether you describe, you know, failing to feed someone as an act of\nwithholding or an omission, either way, you are not bringing them into\ncontact with any force, much less violent physical force.\nMy friend relied very heavily on the common law, as their brief does as\nwell.\nHe says that acts of omission are treated as other acts.\nAnd that, as a general principle, makes sense for liability.\nBut the problem with the government's argument on that is none of\nthose terms make their appearance in the Elements Clause, which talks\nabout the use of violent physical force.\nThat's the thing that has to be present in each case.\nAnd that's why, to your question,",

It may be a very serious crime.\nIt can be punished severely, but it does not categorically involve the use\nof violent physical force.\nThank you.",
