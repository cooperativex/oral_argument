  "background": "Anastasia Wullschleger filed a class-action complaint in Missouri state court against Royal Canin and Nestle Purina, alleging that their requirement for a prescription for specialized dog food was misleading and led to higher prices. The defendants removed the case to federal court, which remanded it back to state court, and then they appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which determined that the antitrust and unjust-enrichment claims raised substantial federal issues and belonged in federal court. Upon returning to the district court, Wullschleger amended her complaint to remove references to federal law, dropped the antitrust and unjust-enrichment claims, and added a civil-conspiracy claim. Despite these changes, the district court exercised federal-question jurisdiction and ultimately granted the manufacturersâ€™ motion to dismiss, leading to a second appeal. Reviewing the case de novo, the Eighth Circuit concluded that amending a complaint to eliminate the only federal questions destroys subject-matter jurisdiction and thus returned the case to state court.",

      "target_dialogue": "## Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe'll hear argument next in Case 23-677, Royal Canin versus\nWullschleger.\nMs. Wellington.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Eighth Circuit's\ndecision below is an extreme outlier.\nIt conflicts with the text and structure of Section 1367 and with more\nthan a century of precedent.\nChief Justice Marshall held in Mollan against Torrance in 1824 that in a\ndiversity case, a federal court's jurisdiction once vested cannot be\ndivested by subsequent events.\nThe Court extended that reasoning to removal actions in Kirby against\nAmerican Soda in 1904.\nAnd in 1938, this Court held in St. Paul Mercury that if the plaintiff after\nremoval amends his pleadings, this does not deprive the district court of\njurisdiction because the defendant's statutory right to removal should\nnot be subject to the plaintiff's caprice.\nThe second Justice Marshall confirmed that conclusion in Carnegie -\nMellon against Cohill in 1988, and Justice Scalia concurred in Rockwell in\n2007.\nRespondents ask this Court to upset that settled interpretation,\nclaiming that it conflicts with the text of Section 1367.\nBut Congress codified this Court's longstanding precedent in the text of\nSection 1367 itself, making clear that if the federal court has original\njurisdiction, it shall continue to have supplemental jurisdiction unless\nCongress expressly provided otherwise.\nRespondents cannot cite a single decision of this Court, a single decision\nof a court of appeals outside of the Eighth Circuit, or a single treatise\nthat supports their position.\nRespondents realize how weak their case is and instead ask the Court to\ndecide something else, whether Grable should be overruled and, if not,\nwhether Grable's requirements were met.\nThis Court did not grant certiorari on either question.\nGrable is settled law, and the Eighth Circuit correctly applied it here.\nThe Court should affirm its longstanding precedent and reverse the\ndecision below.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Wellington:\nCertainly, Your Honor.\nSo th e text of Section 1367 states that there is supplemental jurisdiction\nunless Congress has expressly provided otherwise.\nAnd the text of Section 1367 does not say that when a plaintiff amends\nthe complaint to delete the federal question, there is no longer\nsupplemental jurisdiction.\nAnd that's exactly the interpretive approach that this Court adopted in\nExxon Mobil against Allapattah, where the Court was trying to figure out\nwhat does Section 1367 say about Rule 23 and plaintiffs in class actions.\nAnd the Court looked at Section 1367, said it doesn't say anything about\nRule 23, and that means that there is supplemental jurisdiction.\nThere are also some important structural inferences here.\nSo --so Section 1367(c)(3) makes clear that where the district court has\ndismissed all claims ov er which it has original jurisdiction, it can\ncontinue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.\nAnd that really disposes of the argument that there has to be an ongoing\nfederal question in the case in order for supplemental jurisdiction to be\nwarranted.\nCongress didn't intend that here.",

      "target_dialogue": "## Justice Kagan\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo do you think, Ms. Wellington, that --let's say this wasn't a removal\ncase.\nLet's say this was an original case and it was brought in federal court,\nand then the plaintiff took out the federal claim, leaving only state\nclaims.\nIs there supplemental jurisdiction there?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo this Court has treated these two situations differently, and Justice\nScalia explained why in Rockwell.\nSo there was a concern in Rockwell that when a plaintiff goes into\nfederal court, pleads a federal question, and then immediately or\nsubsequently drops it, that they're trying to plead their way into federal\ncourt.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo forgetting what the reason for that is, you do agree with that rule\nthat once I file a suit in federal court as an original matter, then take out\nthe federal claims, leaving only state law claims, there's nothing at that\npoint for the federal court to do? It's not a doctrine of discretion\nanymore. The federal court has to dismiss.\nIs that correct?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThat is how we have asked this Court to read Rockwell.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nYes.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThat is our view.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo, if that's the case, I don't think that your arguments from 1367 can be\nright because your arguments from 1367 would suggest the opposite\nresult in the case that I gave.\nIn other words, it's very hard to read 1367 as imposing some kind of\ndistinction between original cases and removed cases.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo I agree, Your Honor, that there is no distinction in the text of 1367\nitself.\nThis Court could revisit its decision in Rockwell or limit it to the FCA\ncontext.\nWe haven't asked the Court to do that because we think that we win on\n### Justice Kagan:\nI guess what it suggests to me, though, is, if you were willing to say,\nlook, the Rockwell understanding of original cases is settled, we're not\ncontesting that, then I think your arguments from 1367 go away\nbecause 1367 just doesn't create the kind of distinction that you're\nasking us to create.\nSo either you lose as to removed cases too, or these arguments from the\ntext are just not going to get us to your result.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo we disagree, Your Honor, with your interpretation of the text of\nSection 1367.\nWe think Congress has ma de clear that there is supplemental\njurisdiction unless Congress has expressly provided otherwise.\nIt hasn't done that.\nAnd I think it's very important to consider how Congress came to write\nSection 1367.\nIt was in response to Finley, where this Court took an extremely narrow\nview of -- pendent-claim and pendent-party jurisdiction, pendent-\nparty jurisdiction in particular, and Congress said no, that's not what we\nwant.\nWe want a broader view of pendent -claim and pendent-party\njurisdiction. And that's why they wrote this very broad statute here.\nAnd it would be very strange to conclude that Congress intended to\nabrogate Cohill.",

I -- I can't get over the fact that what Congress\ndid in 1367 was address the questions that had been in the Court.\nThe first one was the diversity issue under St. Paul, and it agreed with\nthe Court.\nIt disagreed with the Court on pendent and supplemental jurisdiction,\nand it wrote a statute to address that.\nAnd yet it knew from Cahill that we had said that if a plaintiff dismisses\nan action, that potentially we go back to the original amendment, and it\ndidn't do what it did for diversity.\nIt wrote it to say only when the district court dismisses the federal\nclaims do you retain supplemental jurisdiction.\nThat, to me, is the statute.\nThey had all our case law.\nThey addressed one -- one thing they agreed with.\nThey disagreed with another, and they disagreed with the third by not\nadopting what it did with diversity.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo two responses, Your Honor.\nFirst, Section (3) --(c)(2) does express -- expressly address this Cohill\nsituation.\nIt says the district courts may decline to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction when the state law claim substantially predominates.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nNo, when the district court has dismissed all claims.\nIt doesn't say when the plaintiff has dismissed all claims.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo I agree, that's (c)(3).\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd when the district court dismisses all federal claims, the party still\nhas a right to appeal, correct?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThat's correct.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nbecause the claim has disappeared, there's no appeal for the defendant\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nI -- I sort of --I think, Your Honor, it depends on the case.\nI think there could still be an appeal in a diversity case where the district\ncourt dismisses a claim and the plaintiff says you shouldn't have\ndismissed that claim.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nNo, but that's because they're there because of the -- the diversity\nprovision of the statute.",

Wellington:\nSo -- so I think it is important here that Congress whole swath took\nparts of Gibbs and Cohill and the lower court cases prior to the\nenactment of the statute.\nSo Section (a) as well as Sections (c)(2) and (3) are word for word from\nGibbs.\nThe top part of Section (c), the district court may decline to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction, that's drawn directly from Cohill.\nAnd (c)(1), where it talks about the claim raises a novel or complex issue\nof state law, that comes from 1980s court of appeals decisions that took\nthat into account when determining whether to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction.",

Wellington:\nSo this Court can decide jurisdictional issues in any order. That's what it\nheld in Sinochem.\nWe agree that there has to be an adjudication of the Grable question in\norder to get to the ultimate, you know, remedy in this case.\nBut that's not what we're asking this Court to decide.\nSo we don't think the Court has to decide the issue.\nIf the Court wants to decide the issue, we think there plainly was\njurisdiction based on the original complaint.

Wellington:\nThat's correct.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThe part in the footnote, you think that's solid.\n### Katherine B.

Wellington:\nSo I think it's very important here that this is a longstanding rule that\nreally reflects the idea that Congress wanted district courts to make the\ndecision. They wanted district courts to decide, is there gamesmanship\ngoing on here? Is there judicial efficiency concerns? Are there comity\nconcerns? And this rule that this Court is talking about would need to\napply to all sorts of different circumstances, such as when the claims\nbecome moot, when the parties settle the claim, when the plaintiff\namends the complaint. And when Congress drafted Section 1367(c),\nwhat it wanted was to give district courts discretion, and that's a\nreflection of decades and decades of precedent, Your Honor.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you. Thank you, counsel.\nJust a brief question.\nYou complain about the forum manipulation problems this would\ncreate.\nI don't see how that's a problem here. They wanted -- they start in\nstate court; they want to go back to state court.\nThey're not trying to manipulate anything.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo we think that it is forum manipulation, particularly in this case,\nwhere th ey waited almost two years to amend the complaint after they\nlose in the Eighth Circuit.\nWe think that's a form of forum manipulation.\nWe think there are much more extreme forms of forum manipulation,\nfor example, where a plaintiff -- you know, the district court says: I' m\nabout to rule against you.\nThat's what happened in three cases on page 16 of the yellow brief.\nAnd the plaintiff says: Great, send me back to state court.\nAnd that's a very serious form of forum manipulation.\nBut we agree, Your Honor, in many cases, the mine-run of cases, you get\nto federal court, you immediately amend the complaint, the federal\njudge is going to send that back to state court.\nWe're really talking about the more unique circumstances like this one\nwhere it's been going on for a long time and Congress wanted district\ncourts to consider different considerations.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you.

Wellington:\nCertainly.\nThat's a really important point.\nSo that is addressed in (c)(2).\nSo, in (c)(2), where there is no longer a federal claim, the state claim will\nsubstantially predominate.\nIt could also fall under (c)(4), an exceptional circumstance.\nI would point out, Your Honor, that (c) is simply listing when district\ncourts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. This Court in\nExxon Mobil against Allapattah said really the key question is, is it in the\nstatute? And -- and, certainly, amendments to the complaint is not in\nthe statute.\nSo we think that's sufficient.\nBut, if you want to look at the text of (c)(2), I think that also answers the\nquestion.\n### Justice Thomas:\nBut -- but do you agree that when the district court dismisses a claim, it\nremains in the case?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nI agree, Your Honor. But that is also true of an amended complaint. You\ncan appeal whether a complaint was properly amended.\nWe cited the Lucente case in the Second Circuit that reinstates the\noriginal complaint on appeal.\nSo, if that's the test, we think that's met.\n### Justice Thomas:\nDo we normally think of a complaint that's amended by the party to\neliminate a federal claim as still having that claim?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nI -- I think that's true of all these circumstances.\nWhere the claim becomes moot, where the parties settle, where the\nplaintiff voluntarily amends, where the district court dismisses, those\nclaims, for the purposes of the party, aren't going to continue to be\nlitigated.\nWe think the important question here is: When do you evaluate whether\nthere is an original federal question in the case? Under this Court's\nlongstanding precedent going all the way back to St. Paul Mercury, you\nlook at the time of removal, Your Honor.\n### Justice Thomas:\nSo when does an amended complaint supersede the earlier complaint?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nYour Honor, we don't think that's the right question.\nThe question isn't whether it supersedes the original complaint.\nThe question is: At the time of removal, is there an original federal\nquestion in the case? We think that's what the phrase \"in the action\" is\ndoing.\nIf you look directly at Gibbs, which is where that language came from,\nGibbs is saying what you need is the original claim and the supplemental\nclaim to be in the same case. That's true regardless of whether the\ncomplaint is amended.\nThat claim was filed in the same case.",

I think\nyou also have to look at this Court's precedents, cases like International\nCollege of Surgeons, Rosado, Carlsbad, Osborn against Haley.\nAll of those cases are suggesting that this is a doctrine of discretion.\nSo this Court has been giving the lower federal courts the same signal\nfor many, many decades that this is how we're going to treat this\nsituation, and we think that's what Congress codified in the text of\nSection 1367 itself.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, do you think that --that courts of appeals read our decisions\ndifferently than we may?

What's the justification for this?\nPlaintiff manipulation, correct?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nIt's much broader than that, Your Honor.\nSo judicial efficiency is a very important reason why Congress enacted\nthe Gibbs principles into Section 1367.\nSo a case may be pending for two or three years.\nThe district court might be really familiar with it.\nIt might be a really straightforward question of state law.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo how doesn't Rule 15 take care of that? It gives plaintiffs a narrow\nwindow to amend and, otherwise, it needs to seek permission.\nSo why didn't the district court simply deny permission here?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThis case was pending almost two years before the amendment was\nmade, but it was still an amendment as of right in this case.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nIt wasn't within the window permitted by the rule.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nIt was, Your Honor, because the case went up on appeal and came down.\nSo there are situations like that.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI see.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nBut there's also -- you know, leave to amend should be freely given\nunder Rule 15.\nThat's not really the kind of standard that takes into account these\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nOh, it certainly does.\nI mean, that's the entire purpose of the freedom -- of the power and\nit's really -- you have an amici, the Center for Litigation and Courts,\nwho supports your argument but says don't rely on that.\nAnd I think they make that point for a reason.\nIt's not your strongest point.\nAnd then I don't understand why we should change all the other rules\nthat respect an amended complaint as the complaint setting forth the\nclaims in an action.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nYour Honor, we think, if you were to rule for the other side, that would be\nupsetting a hundred years of precedent, every single court of appeals\ndecision.\nThat would be changing the rules.\nAll we ask this Court to do here is apply settled law.",

Wellington:\nTwo responses, Your Honor.\nSo I think it's important to keep in mind that the 1911 version of the\nstatute, the predecessor of 1447 that was in effect during St. Paul\nMercury, had basically the same text as it did today.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nI grant -- I grant you that.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nYes.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nAnd now it's come back to looking more directly at the -- the then-\noperative complaint, doesn't it?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo I think it is important that this Court reached the ruling that it did in\nSt. Paul Mercury under the old text.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nYes.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWe've been around that --that tree a few times. So putting aside that\npoint, have you got anything else you want to say about it?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nCertainly. So they didn't make that argument in the red brief because it\ndoesn't answer the question.\nThe question is whether the federal court has jurisdiction or not.\nWe think that's answered at the time of removal.\nAnd this Court, in the Wisconsin Department of Corrections case, said\nthat Section 1447 was merely procedural.\nIt did not affect the district court's jurisdiction.\nSo I think you would have to revisit that case in order to read 1447 here\nthe way you suggest.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nOkay.\nThank you.",

There's just\nboxes everywhere where, you know, in the diversity context, destroying\ndiversity almost always compels dismissal or a remand, but reducing\nthe amount in controversy or changing citizenship of a party almost\nnever does. Right? Is that correct?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThat's correct, Your Honor.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nLike Morgan's Heirs and St. Paul Mercury on the one hand and Owen\nEquipment on the other, there's no logic connecting those things at\nleast as I see it.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThey were just rules out there without connective logic.\nThere might be --each box has its own little idiosyncratic policy\nconsiderations, but there's no connective rule at least as I read it.\nCorrect me if I'm wrong.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nI think you're right.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nOr the other side can correct me if I'm wrong too.\nYeah.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nI think you're right, Your Honor, that there are different rules that apply\nin different circumstances, that they have different policy concerns or\nlongstanding prudential concerns and that this Court shouldn't go\naround disrupting those rules.\nThere are lots of different rules that apply with respect to adding diverse\nparties. Sometimes you can do that.\nSometimes you can't. You can add a non-diverse successor in interest,\nfor example.\nSo there's lots of different circumstances.\nAnd we simply ask the Court to apply settled law.\nWe don't think the Court has to come up with a unifying theory for all\nthese different areas of the law.\nCongress acted with an important reason here with respect to\nsupplemental jurisdiction.\nIt wanted to protect the defendant's right to remove.\nAnd I think that's why you see this broad text here.\nAnd as well as judicial efficiency.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAnd by \"settled law,\" you mean Footnote 6, you mean Cohill? Or what\nare you referring to there?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo you're right, Your Honor.\nSo St. Paul Mercury, Cohill, and Rockwell.\nThere are also cases like Carlsbad, where this Court expressly asked, is a\nCohill remand -- that's the phrase the Court used -- is a Cohill remand\ndiscretionary? I don't think this Court could answer the question yes\nwithout having, again, decided this question.\nThere are other cases like International College of Surgeons and Rosado\nthat, again, emphasize that this is a discretionary question. And I don't\nthink this Court should just depart from all of that precedent here.\nI don't think there's a good reason to.\nAnd this Court should --this is a statutory question. Stare decisis carries\nenhanced force in the statutory context, and that's why we've asked the\nCourt to continue to apply settled law.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThank you.",

Wellington:\nIt's a really important question, Your Honor, because what Congress was\ntrying to do is take into account the right of plaintiffs to be the master of\ntheir complaint but also the right of defendants to remove.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut Justice Gorsuch points to statutes that talk about remand.\nSo, even though the defendant has exercised its right of removal, there\nare circumstances in which that right is not given precedence.\nThe case goes back to state court, right?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThat's exactly right. It's up to the district court to decide.\nAnd we think in the mine run of cases where you amend the complaint\nright after you remove, there's removal to federal court, that's going to\ngo back to state court.\nWhat we're really talking about here are more unusual cases where it's\nbeen going on for a long time.\n### Justice Jackson:\nCan I just ask you about the text, moving quickly because I'm mindful of\nthe time.\nI don't understand how the question could possibly be whether or not\nthere is original jurisdiction at the time of removal. Of course, there is.\nThat's why the case gets to be removed.\nI mean, there's no question there that does any work because you only\nget to remove it if there's original jurisdiction.\nSo isn't the question really what happens when, after we've identified\noriginal jurisdiction and it's removed, the claims over which there were\noriginal jurisdiction drop out? Can supplemental jurisdiction be\nexercised when those original jurisdiction claims are no longer there?\nWhen we look at the text of 1367, I don't understand your argument\nthat supplemental jurisdiction arises in that situation because (a) says,\nin any civil action of which district courts have original jurisdiction, the\ndistrict court shall have supplemental jurisdiction.\nBut, in my scenario, original jurisdiction is gone.\nSo how can you have supplemental jurisdiction in a situation like this?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nI think it's really important to go back to the first principles that this\nCourt was applying in Cohill.\nIt was looking at St. P aul Mercury, which holds that you have original\njurisdiction at a particular time.\nAnd so, once you get original jurisdiction, you continue to have\nsupplemental jurisdiction.\nThat's what the Court held in Rosado.\n### Justice Jackson:\nor ever had original jurisdiction? It seems to be in the present tense\nsaying that you have to have original jurisdiction in order to exercise\nsupplemental.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nAnd I think that's because you have decades and decades of precedent\nsaying that in a removal context, you look at whether there's\njurisdiction at the time of removal.\nAt that time, the district court has original jurisdiction, and then the\nquestion is, will it continue to have supplemental jurisdiction? The text\nhere is framed in a forward-looking future tense, and we think \"shall\nhave\" does cover the situation where there's ongoing supplemental\njurisdiction.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThank you.",

Keller:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The life of the law has not\nbeen logic.\nIt has been experience.\nAnd experience should have taught us by now that a suit arises under\nthe law that creates the cause of action. That should be the definitive\ntest for arising under jurisdiction for at least three reasons. It's the most\nfaithful to the text, it avoids serious constitutional problems, and it will\nsave decades of pointless litigation over jurisdiction.\nNow, if you're not yet ready to re-embrace American Well Works, and it\nsounds like you might not be, I suspect that stare decisis does a fair bit of\nwork, in which case stare decisis applies an easy alternative path to\naffirm.\nThis case is Merrell Dow but for pets not people.\nAnd while I take a back seat to nobody in my love of our four-legged\nfriends, I am confident Congress believed that misbranded human\nproduct was a more substantial federal issue than misbranded pet food.\nIf we turn to which complaint controls, the Eighth Circuit again should\nbe affirmed.\nMy friend and I crucially agree the text of 1367 is dispositive here.\nAnd, remarkably, we also agree, if this case were originally in federal\ncourt, it must be dismissed.\nWhy? Because, by amending out all of the federal issues, they're no\nlonger in the action.\nIf that's what the text of 1367 means for an original case, how can the\nexact same words take on a different meaning with removal? Despite\nmy friend's professed commitment to textualism, she has no choice but\nto flee to public policy.\nWe can't have these mischievous plaintiffs' lawyers shopping around\nfor their judges, we're told.\nNow that concern is not happening in the real world, and my friend's\nsolution wouldn't solve the problem even if it were.\nBut none of that matters.\nThis Court has said many times that text trumps policy. You merely need\nto say so once again in order to affirm.\nI welcome your questions.",

So, like, what harm is this rule doing? And this rule has existed\nin every single circuit court for lo these many years.\n### Ashley C. Keller:\nYeah, so I respectfully disagree.\nThe master principle that I think governs in every context, except the\namount in controversy, is that the amended complaint controls.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo I basically agree with you.\nI mean, I basically agree with you on that and not with Justice\nKavanaugh.\nJustice Kavanaugh says it's all arbitrary.\nI don't think it's arbitrary.\nI think some of the cases that he was talking about is when facts in the\nworld change, but when we're not talking about facts in the world, when\nwe're talking about allegations, I think that the structure is the way you\ndescribe it, that we look to the operative complaint, the amended\ncomplaint, except in the amount in controversy area, where there are\nsort of special considerations.\nBut -- so I -- I kind of agree with you that if we were creating a system\nwhere all the rules cohered, yours is the better rule. But -- but I think on\nthe other side of the table is, look, we have this anomalous rule, but this\nanomalous rule has been accepted b y everybody for many, many years,\nand it does no harm anyway since most of these cases are remanded\nback to state court where they belong.\n### Ashley C. Keller:\nYeah, a couple of responses to that,\n### Justice Kagan:\n.\nFirst of all, I don't think that we, meaning this Court, has ever embraced\nthat rule. It's true that the lower courts deserve respectful\nconsideration, but a lot of these cases predate binding statutory text, so\nI'm not sure that that's dispositive.\nAlso, I would respectfully submit that you're the supervisory Court\nthat's most important in our Article III system.\nAnd when you're hearing a question for the first time, you ought to\nadjudicate it correctly, notwithstanding the respectful consideration\nthat you would give to the lower courts.\nAnd if you've determined, as it sounds like you have, that from first\nprinciples I'm right, the fact that lower courts that obviously can't bind\nthis one got it wrong I don't think is a reason to just say let's go along to\nget along.",

      "target_dialogue": "## Justice Kagan\n### Justice Kagan:\nAnd, you know, I just wonder, so you look at Footnote 6.\nTo me, Footnote 6 is like somebody said: Hey, but how about Cohill? And\nthen they said: Oh, yeah, Cohill, so we have to put in Footnote 6.\nAnd -- and so the fact that Footnote 6 is there suggests a certain kind of\nreading of Cohill.\nAnd, you know, what Cohill was about that it -- was this question of do\nyou have to dismiss a case or can you remand the case back to the state\ncourt? But Cohill's logic does cut against you, I think, fairly heavily here\nbecause, as I read, Cohill what it does is say something like this: You\nknow, the supplemental jurisdiction business, ever since Gibbs, we've\nunderstood it as a completely discretionary area of jurisdiction.\nYou can keep the case.\nYou can dismiss the case.\nIf you can keep the case and you can dismiss the case, surely you should\nbe able to remand the case as well.\nAnd that's the essential logic of Cohill.\nIt's like everything is discretionary in this area, why shouldn't this be\ntoo? But that logic really does cut against you because it suggests that\neverything is discretionary in this area, including keeping the case.\n### Ashley C. Keller:\nYeah, a couple of responses to that,\n### Justice Kagan:\n.\nWhatever amount of discretion I think existed in the Cohill era I don't\nthink can continue through binding statutory text.\nSo we're no longer operating in a common law realm. We're operating in\na realm where Congress chose to act.\nWe can debate whether Congress chose to codify whatever the common\nlaw rules were hook, line, and sinker.\nI would suggest from -- Allapattah that it codified binding statutory\ntext, and we should follow the text.\nSo I don't think we can just go with free-wheeling old principles now\nthat Congress\nWell, how about if I think that the text doesn't really help either of you?\nThe -- you know, you're saying text; you're saying text, and, in fact,\nneither of you really has a very strong argument about text and we have\nto decide this case on other grounds.\n### Ashley C. Keller:\nSo the other grounds, I think, would be the master pri nciple that we\ntalked about that the operative complaint almost always controls.\nThe only context that I'm aware of where it doesn't control is the\namount in controversy.\nThat, by the way, was also codified through binding text.\nThat's 1446.\nI agree that it goes back longer to cases like St. Paul Mercury.\nAs an aside, I actually think that's a completely defensible\ninterpretation of the old statutory text precisely because Congress\nunderstands it doesn't want to blur the line between jurisdictional facts\nand the merits. We don't want to create the Judge Posner problem\nwhere a plaintiff comes into court and loses or wins an amount that's\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.",

Keller:\nI think that I would win this case if 1367 hadn't been enacted and we\nwere still in a more common law regime and this issue were squarely\npresented to the Court for the first time.\nCohill had this issue obliquely presented.\nYes, there was an amended complaint. But the party presentation rule\nshould matter. No one made that fact relevant for the Court's\nconsideration.\nYou could have considered it sua sponte because it went to jurisdiction,\nbut no one did.\nAnd this Court has pointed out before that drive -by jurisdictional\nrulings don't have any precedential effect.\nThe reason you had to say that is sometimes, even though you would\nlike to avoid it, you issue drive-by jurisdictional rulings.",

As I\nunderstand it, in -- the question there was whether to remand or\ndismiss, and this -- this issue wasn't presented to the Court at all.\n### Ashley C. Keller:\nI completely agree with it.\nIt was not presented to the Court.\nThe facts of Cohill, though, I have to say in the -- in the spirit of candor\nwas that there was an amended complaint and it dropped the federal\nclaim, and then there was the question of whether there is discretion to\nremand versus just discretion to dismiss for lack of continuing\njurisdiction.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nAnd do you have any way to rationalize St. Paul Mercury other than it's\nbeen codified now?\n### Ashley C. Keller:\nNo, I do think that I can rationalize St. Paul Mercury.\nAs I was saying just a moment ago, I do think that the amount in\ncontroversy, even before Congress said in 1446 we have to look to the\ninitial pleading, going back to cases like St. Paul Mercury, it is reasonable\nto read -- read the words \"amount in controversy\" to mean\ntheoretically possible to be recovered.\nIt doesn't matter what happens after you file your lawsuit.\nAnd so, if the plaintiff pleads in an initial complaint, consistent with\nRule 11 or whatever the equivalent was in 1938, I'm above the\njurisdictional amount in controversy, that's showing that it's\ntheoretically possible to recover that amount in good faith, and that's\ngood enough for the statutory jurisdictional requirement that Congress\nadded onto Article III.",

Wellington:\nThank you, Your Honor.\nAs Justice Kagan says, under experience, Respondents lose.\nTo rule for Respondents on the question presented, this Court would\nneed to overrule or distinguish away St. Paul Mercury, Cohill, Rockwell,\nGibbs, Carlsbad, Rosado, Powerex, Osborn against Haley, International\nCollege of Surgeons, and Wisconsin Department of Corrections.\nThat's 10 decisions of this Court, on top of dozens and dozens of court of\nappeals decisions that have consistently and unanimously supported\nPetitioners' position.\nIndeed, even Respondents agreed that the district court could exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction.\nThey said it in their amended complaint.\nIt's only until the Eighth Circuit invited briefing on this that they\nswitched positions.\nAnd I think it's quite telling here that the Eighth Circuit reached the\ndecision it did by apparently missing all of the footnotes that it should\nhave read, including in Rockwell but also in the Second Circuit and the\nEleventh Circuit decisions that it cited.\nSo I think that's the reason we're here today.\nAs Justice Barrett asked, ruling for Respondents would also call into\nquestion the rule that applies in CAFA cases.\nThe court of appeals have said -- you know, if you get into federal court\non a removal in a CAFA case, the plaintiff immediately amends to try to\nget rid of all the class action allegations, the courts of appeals have said\nthat's a question of discretion for the district court.\nMaybe the district court will send a lot of those cases back to state court,\nbut maybe, when the case has been going on for two years and the class\nis about to get certified, that's a situation in which the district court\nmay say, okay, I'm going to keep this case here in federal court.\nIt would also call into question the Court's longstanding rules that\namendments to the amount in controversy do not affect jurisdiction.\nAnd what do Respondents want instead? So, instead of an approach that\ngives district courts discretion in every case to determine what makes\nsense as a matter of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and\ncomity, they want an inflexible rule that gives district courts no choi ce\nand that would subject the defendant's right to removal to the\nplaintiff's caprice.\nAs the Chief's questions suggest, where this Court decides to overrule\nevery single court of appeals, it should have a really good reason.\nAnd there isn't a really good reason here to upset a longstanding\njurisdictional rule that has worked just fine for a century.\nThe Eighth Circuit simply got it wrong, and this Court should vacate the\ndecision below.\nThank you.\n\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you.
