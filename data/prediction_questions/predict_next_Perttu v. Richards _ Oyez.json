  "background": "Richards, an inmate at Michigan’s Baraga Correctional Facility, sued Resident Unit Manager Thomas Perttu for sexual harassment and retaliation. Richards alleged that Perttu destroyed multiple grievances he attempted to file regarding Perttu's sexual abuse. Additionally, Richards claimed Perttu threatened to kill him if he continued trying to file grievances and wrongfully placed him in administrative segregation. After Perttu moved for summary judgment arguing the inmates failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and Richards cross-moved raising constitutional claims, the district court denied both motions due to factual disputes. A magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing and recommended finding that Perttu proved the inmates failed to exhaust remedies. The district court adopted this recommendation and dismissed the case. Richards appealed, and after requesting supplemental briefing on whether the Seventh Amendment requires a jury for exhaustion disputes intertwined with case merits, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that it does and reversed the judgment of the district court.",

Sherman:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Exhaustion is the\ncenterpiece of Congress's reforms under the Prison Litigation Reform\nAct.\nYet, even with this invigorated exhaustion requirement, prisoner\nlawsuits still account for an outsize share of filings in federal district\ncourts.\nA rule that requires a jury trial on intertwined exhaustion issues would\nincrease this burden while incentivizing non-exhaustion and\nundermining the goals and structure of the PLRA.\nRespondent would have this Court cast aside the PLRA's goals and\nstructure merely because exhaustion is an affirmative defense. Focusing\non this Court's holding in Jones versus Bock, he contends that there's no\nprincipled reason for treating PLRA exhaustion differently than other\naffirmative defenses that are routinely sent to juries when there are\nfacts intertwined with the merits.\nJones does not stand for this broad proposition.\nIt held only that prisoners need not plead exhaustion.\nAnd there is a principled reason for treating PLRA exhaustion differently\nthan other affirmative defenses.\nIt is a mandatory prerequisite to suit.\nSo its intended benefits would be entirely undercut by merits discovery\nand a trial before its resolution.\nPLRXA -- PLRA exhaustion must be resolved by a judge at the early\nstages of litigation.\nContrary to the Sixth Circuit, this does not run afoul of the Seventh\nAmendment even when there are intertwined facts.\nThe judge's determination on exhaustion does not interfere with the\njury's ultimate fact-finding role because dismissal is typically without\nprejudice and the judge's determination on exhaustion would not have\npreclusive effect.\nRichards, like many other prisoners, can exhaust, come back, and have a\njury decide the merits of any viable claims.\nFor this reason, this Court should reverse the Sixth Circuit's decision.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

I guess what I was a\nlittle confused about from your briefing was that I took you to concede\nthat there's intertwinement here.\nAnd if that's the case, we can just assume, I guess, that ex haustion does\nnot entitle you to a jury.\nThat's the part of this that would ordinarily say you don't get a jury, but\nit's the fact of intertwinement that brings to the fore the question of\nwhether or not the Seventh Amendment has to be satisfied.\nSo we don't really have to worry or think about or rule on whether or not\nthe exhaustion claim gets a jury independent of the other one, right?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nI don't think the Court has to rule on that.\nI think it's a question that is naturally embedded in the question\npresented.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI understand, but if I assume it, okay, so fine, aren't we still faced with\nthe question that you present, as a matter of your question presented, is\nthen we have intertwinement of a claim that does not get a jury, the\nexhaustion claim, with a claim that does? Do you concede that the First\nAmendment retaliation claim is one that would ordinarily go to the jury?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nWhen -- when the right to a jury trial accrues and exhaustion has been\nmet, I agree that that is a claim that should go to the jury.\nAnd this Court has been very clear that 1983 claims are entitled to a jury\ntrial.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAll right.\nSo we do have the intertwinement.\nAt least you concede it in your brief.\nAnd so why wouldn't the sort of standard Beacon Theatres view of how\nwe deal with that situation apply here?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nBeacon Theatres doesn't apply here for a number of reasons.\nOne, Beacon Theatres was driven by a concern for collateral estoppel.\nWould there -- would there be a preclusive effect that would completely\ncut off any right to have the -- the --the jury trial on the merits?\n### Justice Jackson:\nI don't see that in the opinion.\nI mean, I see that it talks about preclusive effect, but that didn't\nnecessarily seem to me to be driving the analysis.\nAnd -- and we've had a lot of cases that have applied this sort of\nintertwinement principle in which preclusion really hasn't been the\nmain focus.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nI think Beacon Theatres itself talked about preclusion, preclusive effect,\nand that being a concern.\nAnd later on, this Court in Parklane Hosiery said, when we looked at\nBeacon Theatres, which, again, this Court has said is -- collateral\nestoppel is only a flexible, judge-made doctrine, and -- and this Court\n### Justice Jackson:\nAll right.\nSo why isn't that a case here? I mean, what --what law do we have that\nsays that an exhaustion determination by a judge in this situation that\nrequires them to find all the facts about whether or not there was actual\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nWell, what we have here is the flexible doctrine of collateral estoppel\nand what we know about collateral estoppel and why it's applied and\nwhy it doesn't get applied. And one of the big issues here is that you\ndon't -- this Court has said over and over in cases, and so have the lower\ncourts, that collateral estoppel is applied -- is not applied when the\nlitigants have not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate.\nAnd when a litigant is litigating -- on either side is litigating\nexhaustion, they have not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate on\nthe merits even if there are overlapping factors.",

Sherman:\nUnder the Prison Rape Elimination Act, First Amendment retaliation for\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo that's it.\nBut what happens to the ordinary prisoner? If we announced the rule\nthat you want us to announce, which is exhaustion never goes to a jury,\nin the mine-run of cases that are not rape-related, prisoners are\nprecluded, practically speaking.\nWe have an amicus brief that says that most exhaustion requirements\nare --half of them, half the states, are 15 days or less.\nAnd in the others, they are matters of days more than that but no more\nthan 30.\nMost of the time, when you file a suit as a prisoner, it takes --the answer\ntakes 30 days.\nSo most cases as a practical matter would be precluded if we adopt your\nrule that exhaustion under all circumstances is not preclusive.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nI don't agree that in most cases the prisoner would not be able to return.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy not?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo, if they're very short, it seems to me, as a practical matter, I can't see\nhow almost any prisoner could go back.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nYou have 31 states, the District of Columbia, and the Bureau -- Federal\nBureau of Prisons, all that allow for some level of discretion to excuse\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWait a minute. That depends on you, meaning the prison.\nWhy would a prison ever do it? Are you aware of any prison that says you\nfailed to exhaust, but now you can come back?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nThe reason -- I assume that when they put it -- they can -- they don't\nhave to put it in their policy, so if they put it in their policy, I assume that\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThis is news to me that there is any state that says if you fail to -- you go\nto court, they say you failed to exhaust after a factual finding, that we're\nnow going to let you come back to court after you've brought it back to\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nDoes your state do that?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nYes.\nYes.\nWe have a provision.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nNo, no.\nPoint -- I'd like you --I ask the Court to -- to have you give us examples\nof that situation occurring.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nI -- I can't provide those examples.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nYou can't because I haven't found one.\nThe policy is discretionary.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nWell, I --this policy is discretionary.\nAnd I -- the reason that a prison system would want to do that is\nbecause everything in the PLRA is designed to encourage, to allow the\nprison system to work out their problems, and they do want to work\nthose out.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nCounsel, what you are proposing to me is that they have an exhaustion\nrequirement that they're willing to excuse every time a prisoner goes to\ncourt, the court says you failed to exhaust, and now the prison's going to\nsay come back and we'll let you exhaust now anyway.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nIt -- it --it will depend on the circumstances.\nThere -- there -- and -- and a lot of these policies say there are\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nIt -- it -- it begs the question -- it begs the question that a judge has\nfound that the prison guard didn't stop you from exhausting and now\nthe state is going to permit you to come back and try again.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nI think it is in the best interest of the prison systems to try to work out\nproblems.\nAnd one of the things that our amicus, multi-state amicus brief, led by\nOhio, has pointed out is that under Mr. Richards's rule, if this Court\nadopts it, there are going to be very few prison systems that want to\nallow for any excusal of untimeliness.\nThat's going to be a disincentive for them to do that because they've\nalready gone through a jury trial.\nNow why are they going to excuse untimeliness? But, if they -- a\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nHuh?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI --I -- I'm a little lost.\nThey've gone through a jury trial.\nThey won.\nAnd the prison is going to listen to the complaint again?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy would they bother?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy would the state bother having -- want to?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhat incentive does it need to?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nThe question is whether Richards's rule incentivizes any kind of\ndiscretion.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThank you, counsel.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWe're on different pages.",

Sherman:\nBeacon Theatres doesn't say that because Beacon Theatres was not\ndealing with a prerequisite to suit and then a later legal issue.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo that's true.\nI mean, that's a factual distinction.\nAnd I guess the question is why should that factual distinction matter if\nwhat I said was true, is that the judge and jury are expected to decide the\nsame questions on the same facts.\nLike, whether we label something a prerequisite or an affirmative\ndefense or anything else under the sun, the same problem is being\npresented, which is that in that case, the -- it -- it seems as though it's\nnot protective of the Seventh Amendment right for you have to\nconvince the judge before you can get to the jury.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nWhen an equitable and a legal claim arise together and those claims\nhave --are -- are now in front of a -- a court fully, that --now Beacon\nTheaters matters and now preclusion matters.\nWhen you have --it does matter.\nthe prerequisites aren't met, this Court has said, if you have to meet\ncertain prerequisites in order to have your case proceed and those\nprerequisites haven't been met, then the case doesn't proceed. This\nCourt said that in Woodford versus Ngo.\nAnd so it is everything that the case --the case isn't proceeding.\nAnd then, when it does proceed, if there is no collateral estoppel effect,\npreclusion isn't barring the -- the jury from performing full on their\nfact-finding role.\nAnd that is what -- that is what the Seventh Amendment preserves and\nonly what the Seventh Amendment preserves.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.",

Sherman:\nIf for those prisoners that can't come back because there has been\neither a dismissal with prejudice or because their -- their prison system\ndoesn't allow for any -- any kind of leeway, any discretion, for those\nprisoners, there still is not a violation of a Seventh Amendment right.\nLooking back historically, there is no Seventh Amendment right to be\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nSo there's -- so preclusion really has nothing to do with it then on your\ntheory.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nIt --it has something to do with the inquiry for those prisoners that can\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nI'm asking about those who can't.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nYes.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nSo something else has to be doing the work.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWhat is that something else?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nWhat's doing the work for the prisoners that can't come back is that\ntheir claims --they have not met the exhaustion requirements that\nCongress set forth.\nCongress can set forth what they have to prove in front of a jury, and\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWell, now that's interesting.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nOkay.\nSo that's essentially saying Congress can choose to get rid of the jury.\nAnd I thought just last term, in Jarkesy, where Congress expressly said\nno jury trial right, and we said no.\nWe said nice policy you have there.\nWe've got the Seventh Amendment here.\nNo good.\nNow why would we interpret the PLRA, which is silent about juries, to\nhave a rule that you never get a jury? That -- I agree, I think that has to\nbe your argument.\nIt can't be this exhaustion thing because you want the same rule\nwhether they're precluded or not precluded. It's got to be that there's a\ncongressional policy, but yet there's none embodied in the\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nThe congressional policy is in the PLRA.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nIt says exhaustion, but it doesn't talk about juries.\nWhy shouldn't we understand that statute as we often have against the\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nMm-hmm.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nIt doesn't -- because it doesn't implicate the Constitution.\nAnd I -- I -- although the PLRA did not say -- Congress did not say this\nhas to be decided by a judge instead of a jury, Congress was not silent on\nthat issue either.\nThey said \"no action shall be brought until.\" Now Congress also didn't\nuse the term \"proper exhaustion.\" But this Court said everything in the\nPLRA, the language, the way it was structured, suggested that proper\nexhaustion was -- was -- was what had to happen.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nNow you're not disputing at common law somebody could bring a suit\nfor sexual abuse and ask for a jury, right? You don't dispute that?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nI don't dispute that.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nYeah.\nAll right. And, here, we have an individual who brought such a claim, and\ninstead of a -- and demanded a jury of his peers and, instead, he got a\nmagistrate judge over Zoom.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nBecause Congress can set what has to be required, what has to be met in\norder to get your jury trial right.\nThat is not -- that leaves intact the Seventh Amendment.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nAnd it says you can have sovereign immunity as a defense and there's\ncertain jurisdictional amounts and lots of other things, and in all of\nthose circumstances through history, we've said, when those are bound\nup with merits questions, the jury right wins out.\nWe're going to presume the jury. We're not going to -- we're not going\nto go against that presumption, absent something clearer.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nThis Court has given district courts even in the jurisdictional context\nwide authority to decide the mode of how to decide jurisdictional\nquestions. And this Court has said when it is dependent -- and I read -- I\nread Land versus Dollar to be pretty much wholly dependent, the\njurisdictional question, on get -- you can't answer it until you get to the\nmerits.\nAnd then the -- the -- the Court has said, you know, it should go to a\njury.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nYeah.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nThere is nothing stop -- in the jurisdictional context, especially because\nthe door is closing for that litigant, there's -- there's nothing that stops\nthe jury --the judge from having that discretion. Here, the barrier is the\nlanguage of the PLRA.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nYeah.\nThank you.",

Sherman:\nThank you.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nMs. McGill.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I just wanted\nto begin with two clarifying points.\nThis is the first time in this five years of litigation that the State has\nrepresented that the --all of the claims might be able to be exhausted.\nThe First Amendment claim that was the subject of the Sixth Circuit's\ndecision here, as far as we can tell, is not protected by the PREA policy.\nAnd the Sixth Circuit held that exhaustion and the merits here were\ncompletely coterminous under Sixth Circuit First Amendment law.\nThe State also agrees that the historical facts at issue here are of the\ntype that juries decide, and I think that makes this an easy case on the\nactual question presented because, whatever else is true, this is a 1983\naction for money damages.\nSo the jury must resolve those facts regardless of how you characterize\nexhaustion.\nThat is the point of Beacon Theatres, which is just a specific application\nof the general rule that even truly threshold issues must be deferred to\nthe jury when they're intertwined with the merits.\nIt's no answer to say that the facts could be relitigated in front of a jury\nmaybe if and only if the case proceeds.\nIt's simply not good enough that the jury trial right might sometimes be\npreserved.\nAnd the State's suggestion that judicial findings would not be binding\non a future hypothetical fact-finder really gives the game away.\nThe only reason that would be so is because of the Seventh Amendment.\nThat was this Court's unanimous holding in Lytle.\nAnd there's certainly nothing in the statute or the federal rules that\nwould suggest the non-binding factual findings procedure that the\nState suggests here.\nThe State warns that having jury trials on exhaustion will undermine the\ngoals of the PLRA.\nThose very same arguments were presented and rejected in Jones, and\nthey're even less persuasive here.\nThe State's approach would not reduce the number of trials required.\nWe're talking about the cases that have survived judicial screening and\nRule 56, the needles in the haystack as it were.\nRegardless, policy arguments are no match for the Bill of Rights.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

      "target_dialogue": "## Justice Barrett\n### Justice Barrett:\nCounsel, can I ask you a question? This is a methodological one.\nIn some ways, this case presents the problem that we've seen in the\nSecond Amendment context because this is a history and tradition test,\nbut it's one that goes all the way back to Justice Story in, like, 1812,\nright? And, you know, in other cases, we've been able to draw analogs\nbased on the cause of action.\nAnd I think that's a more or less stable line when you're trying to find a\nhistorical analog, is this more like a common law or an equitable\nquestion.\nThis defense thing is a lot harder, right, especially since there was no\nreally good analog at the time of the founding.\nSo I think what we have now is Congress coming up with something new\nand then how do -- what do we do in the face of historical uncertainty.\nAnd, you know, functional considerations may guide, but I guess what\nI'm trying to figure out --and this is really just a question -- I mean, it's\ntrue, as you say, that one set of circumstances we could look at in\nmaking a judgment about whether this goes to a jury or has to go to a\njury if he invokes the Seventh Amendment right is the factual nature of\nAnother one, though, is does Congress have some room here to create\nnew defenses that are functioning more as equitable, like these\nthreshold questions.\nAnd it seems to me l ike in Wetmore, the Court did, even though\njurisdiction was a jury issue in the beginning, did kind of back off a little\nbit and said: Well, you know, a judge has discretion to go one way or\nanother based on the 1875 Act that didn't lock in the form of pleading.\nSo, I mean, I -- I guess my question is: In the face of historical\nuncertainty, how do we weigh what Congress has to say about threshold\nconsiderations? Because it is clear that in the PLRA, exhaustion was\ndesigned to try to weed out suits.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nOkay.\n### Justice Barrett:\nI'm not saying that that's determi native.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nRight.\n### Justice Barrett:\nI'm just trying to figure out how to think about it.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nI think I understand the question.\nI mean, I think most of your question is sort of answered by the detailed\nanalysis of the majority opinion and Justice Scalia's concurring opinion,\nwhich the majority said that they agreed with in full in Del Monte Dunes.\nAnd, there, I mean, history certainly was the guide and -- and provided\nthe analog, which was a common law, you know, tort claim for damages,\nwas the historical analog that allowed the Court to say: No question that\na 1983 action for damages is an action at law.\nAnd so the question is, you know, how -- what work does the history do\non the specific issue question, and I think the Court resolved that by\nsimply saying: Where we don't have a guide, we look to precedent and\nthen, you know, functional considerations.\nAnd the Court described those functional considerations as preserving\nthe -- the jury's historic role as the trier of fact. So I think it's sort of a\nwell -worn path. And the -- the only thing I would add is that this Court\nlast term in Jarkesy pointed out that Congress can't sort of take an\naction at law and morph it into something else by tweaking its elements\nor adding something or narrowing it in some respect and then just\nsaying: Hey, this isn't actually the common law cause of action\nanymore.\n### Justice Barrett:\nYeah.\nBut, in Jarkesy -- I agree, but in Jarkesy, we drew an analogy to fraud and\nsaid, like, this is fraud, it's analogous to frog and -- fraud, not frog, sorry\nAnd, here, the problem is we don't have that same line.\nAnd I'm not saying that -- I'm not saying that you lose.\nI'm just saying we haven't had a case quite like this where we had to\nmake that methodological choice, which does make it a bit different.\nAnd I think Wetmore does complicate the question --the issue a little\nbit for you.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nSo I think, if you --if you wanted to take a slightly more circuitous route\nthan what Justice Scalia and the majority did in Del Monte Dunes, what\nyou would say is: We have this action at law.\nThere's no specific analog.\nBut you could still look to history to see, for example, well, what are the\ntypes of -- you know, would a jury have --have gotten to decide factual\nissues with respect to an affirmative defense in this type of tort action\nand common law.\nWe think that historical answer is very clear.\nSo, even though there wasn't an affirmative defense called\n\"exhaustion\" in 1791, there were affirmative defenses to tort liability\ndamages, including the statute of limitations.\nAnd we know that juries decided factual disputes with regard to an\naffirmative defense.",

You try the -- whichever one you want to do first and then\nyou try the other one.\nIf it's a rule of equity, then that -- a rule of equity is different from\nanything that's protected by the Seventh Amendment.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nSo I think, you know, this Court's unanimous opinion in Lytle referred to\nit as a constitutional mandate that the Seventh Amendment --that\nLytle's Seventh Amendment rights could not be protected, except for a\nremand on a clean slate with a -- a jury trial on all the issues that had\nalready been decided by the Court.\nAnd it did that.\nIt -- it sort of declined to apply collateral estoppel, which is, I -- I think,\nthe solution the State is proposing here, only because, otherwise, the\nSeventh Amendment would be violated.\nBut this Court has solved that problem by saying ex ante we want to\navoid judicial fact findings that are going to extinguish legal claims, so\nwe're going to make sure the jury goes first. And it doesn't mean that\nthere's exact perfect co --- you know, a coextensive intertwinement.\nIt's enough that the judge decides a fact that the jury would have to\ndecide the other way in order to prevail on the merits of the claim.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, as you present this, this may not be just a case about the right to a\njury trial on the issu e of exhaustion under the PLRA when there's\nintertwinement because it may have a lot of other implications.
