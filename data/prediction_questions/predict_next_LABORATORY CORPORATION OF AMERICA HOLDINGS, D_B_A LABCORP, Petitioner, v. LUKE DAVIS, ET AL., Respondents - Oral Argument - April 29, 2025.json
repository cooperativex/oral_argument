  "background": "Julian Vargas, who is blind, encountered inaccessible check-in kiosks at LabCorp facilities. Vargas attempted to use these kiosks but was unable due to their lack of accessibility for visually impaired individuals. As a result, he had to wait for assistance from a staff member, which delayed his check-in and denied him equal access to services such as maintaining his spot in the queue or updating personal information privately. Vargas claimed that this lack of accessibility infringed on his rights under disability laws, leading to the lawsuit. The district court certified two classes: a California class for Unruh Civil Rights Act claims and a nationwide class for claims under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Affordable Care Act. LabCorp appealed the class certification, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision.",

Francisco:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Two basic principles\nresolve this case.\nFirst, a class action is just a tool for aggregating claims.\nSo, if an individual plainti� doesn't have Article III standing to bring his\nown claim, he can't bring it as part of a class either.\nThat's why Laroe held that an intervenor has to show Article III standing\nin order to intervene, and, as Justice Scalia said in Shady Grove, class\nactions are just another species of joinder. Second, Rule 23(b)(3)'s\npredominance requirement leads to the same result.\nIf a class is de�ned to include plainti�s without Article III standing and,\nas a result, you need thousands of mini-trials to separate the wheat\nfrom the cha�, the Article III issue necessarily swamps any common\nones. This case is a perfect example. Plainti�s who don't want to use\nkiosks don't have standing to challenge how kiosks work any more than\na vegan has standing to challenge how a restaurant de�nes a mediumLABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n1 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nrare steak. As a result, the Court needs to assess whether each of the\n8,000 to 112,000 class members actually want to use kiosks, and that\nwill necessarily swamp any common issues, as the D.C. and First Circuits\ncorrectly held in the Rail Freight and Asacol cases. Plainti�'s only\nresponse is to say that courts should assess the merits �rst and\njurisdiction second.\nBut that makes no sense. What if they lose on the merits? Either the\nunnamed class members are bound by a judgment regardless of\nwhether the court had Article III jurisdiction over it, or the court has to\ndetermine if it had jurisdiction over each plainti� in the �rst place.\nAnd that's why courts have to address the jurisdiction before the merits,\njust like in every other case. Plainti�'s rule, in contrast, assumes either\nthey win or coerce a settlement, but there's no basis for that \"heads I\nwin, tails you lose\" approach to Article III. I welcome your questions.",

But their understanding of\nthe language of the statute that the district court adopted was that that\nincludes anybody who walked into the facility.\nAgain, this is what they said, my friends said, in their brief to the Ninth\nCircuit when we were all talking about the May de�nition.\nThey said that standing is established for all legally blind Californians\nwho visited one of the 280 facilities that featured a kiosk. They then\nexplained that the way that you identify who's in that class is by simply\nlooking at LabCorp records that show who visited, who were their\npatients, and you match that up to other medical records that show who\nwas blind. The district court adopted that, and we know that for two\nreasons.\nWe know that, one, because the district court de�ed -- said that that's\nexactly how it would resolve -- de�ne who was in the class, and two,\nbecause it adopted the August de�nition that clearly does that and then\ntold everybody that that August de�nition meant the exact same thing\nas the May de�nition.\nThat's why, Your Honor, we actually could not have appealed the August\norder if we wanted to.\nThe binding rule in the Ninth Circuit is that if a subsequent certi�cation\norder makes immaterial changes to a prior certi�cation order, the 14-\nday statute of limitations runs o� of the prior order, not the subsequent\none.\nThe district court, having squarely held that the August order was not\nmaterially di�erent than the May order, it would have precluded us from\nappealing the August order and left us stuck with the May order. The\nreason none of this mattered is because everybody that the two orders\nmeant the exact same thing.\nTo the extent there was any daylight, the district court went further and\nsaid the August order is simply amending the text of the May order.\nThat's why, while the Ninth Circuit said I'm not going to address any\nissues that pertain only to the August order, and that was failsafe issue,\nit argued --it claimed, I think erroneously, but it claimed that ourLABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n18 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nfailsafe argument pertained only to the August order, but the Ninth\nCircuit did address the very question that we've asked this Court to\nresolve.\nIt just got it wrong.\nIt resolved it against us. That's the decision that's before you. You\nclearly have certiorari jurisdiction over that decision for the reasons that\nmy friend in the previous case very well articulated when he was\nstanding up here.\n### Justice Thomas:\nAt what point does the uninjured -- having uninjured plainti�s in -- in\nthe class present a problem for Rule 23 or for Article III?\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nSure.\nSo I'll take them in order. I think, for Article III, if the class on its face is\nde�ned such that it clearly sweeps in uninjured people, I think that you\ncan't certify that class.\nYou got to tell them to rede�ne the class so that it's limited to people\nover whom there's jurisdiction. Again, I think that can be solved\nrelatively easily in a case like this by simply rede�ning the class to\ninclude, you know, at a minimum, people who wanted to use the kiosk.\nThe problem with that is it walks you straight into the Rule 23(b)(3)\nissue where the question is, when you've got an overly broad class\nde�nition, is there a way that you can sever out -- separate out the\ninjured and uninjured in an administrable way. I can give you an example\nthat illustrates it.\nTake the TransUnion case.\nIn TransUnion, you had a couple of thousand out of 6,000 plainti�s\nwhose credit reports actually were disseminated to third parties.\nIf they had come in as they originally did and said the class includes\neverybody who's --for whom there was a violation, a class of 6,000\npeople, that would be an overbroad class and I don't think you could\ncertify it. But what you could say to them is you need to rede�ne the\nclass.\nRede�ne the class to include only those individuals whose credit reports\nwere disseminated to third parties. Then you'd have a class that'sLABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n19 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nde�ned to include only people who su�ered an Article III injury.\nIt would satisfy the Article III issue. You then have to move to the 23(b)\n(3) issue and ask is there an easy way to separate the wheat from the\ncha�.\nIn that case, there probably would have been.\nYou probably could have just look at TransUnion's records to separate\nthe wheat from the cha�. But, in lots of cases, there is no easy way.\nThat was Judge Katsas's opinion in Railway, Judge Kayatta's opinion in\nAsacol and this case because, in this case, the only way that you can\ndetermine whether, at a minimum, somebody even wanted to use one\nof those kiosks is by putting that person on the stand.\nIt's -- it's obviously --it's, after all, quite obvious that there are many\npeople in this world who don't like to use kiosks. I happen to be one of\nthem.\nIf Labcorp adopted a policy that said that �ve-foot-eight overweight\nFilipino American men have to use the front desk and not the kiosk, I\nwould say hallelujah.\nThat might violate somebody's rights.\nIt doesn't violate my rights.\nAnd the only way to �gure out -- that out in this case is through doing\nthe thousands of mini-trials.\n### Justice Thomas:\nThank you.",

I'm troubled by the Ninth Circuit's rule that a new\nnotice of appeal must be �led or a prior notice of appeal must be\namended if the district court, while a class certi�cation appeal is\npending in the court of appeals, makes a material change in the class\ncerti�cation but, presumably, not if the district court makes an\nimmaterial change. And that's what we've been -- we've spent most of\nthe argument this morning on that issue.\nBut whether someone has to �le a notice of appeal is supposed to beLABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n20 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nclear, and that is such an unclear rule. I'm wondering whether that's the\nroot of the problem that we've been discussing.\nBut you -- you seem to accept the proposition that we should view this\nmatter through the lens of this Ninth Circuit rule about what needs to be\ndone.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nWell, Your Honor, I -- I don't necessarily accept the premise, and I think\nthat might be another way to go about it. But what I do think is that the\nOne, the Ninth Circuit squarely addressed this question, and the reason\nit squarely addressed this question was because, under the rules that\nthe Ninth Circuit applies, this issue was squarely before it.\nThe May order, the May order was before it.\nThe Ninth Circuit and the district court repeatedly made clear the\nAugust order didn't materially change anything.\nThat meant both of them presented the exact same issue.\nThat again is why the Ninth Circuit said I'm not going to address an issue\nthat pertains only to the August order, and it didn't.\nIt refused to address that. But it did say I am going to address an issue\nthat relates to the May order because, on that issue, there is no\ndi�erence between the May order and the August order.\nThey present the same thing. I think, though, that the way you cut\nthrough all of this is you recognize that this Court is a court of review.\nIt's reviewing the Ninth Circuit's decision.\nThe Ninth Circuit entered a judgment against us in which it adopted a\nlegal rule.\nThat legal rule in our view is wrong.\nAnd you have jurisdiction under the certiorari statute to say whether or\nnot the rule that the Ninth Circuit adopted is wrong.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, the rule -- the rule for �ling a notice of appeal, when a district\ncourt keeps changing its class certi�cations, could be you always have to\n�le a new notice of appeal or you always have to amend.\nAll right --LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n21 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Alito:\nEverybody could -- would understand it, so everybody could comply.\nThe rule could be, no, you never have to do that.\nOnce there's a certi�cation, the case is in the court of appeals.\nIf the district court can't make up its mind or it gets worried about the\nfact that -- about the possibility it's going to be reversed on appeal,\nwell, that's too bad.\nThe --whatever the --the latest certi�cation order is before the court\nof appeals, unless the court of appeals chooses as a matter of discretion\nto dismiss the appeal. Either of those would be clear.\nBut what we have in the Ninth Circuit is something that is utterly\nunclear, drawing a distinction between a material change and an\nimmaterial change.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nI --I think that is a fair general criticism.\nI, though, think that in the application of this case, it's quite easy\nbecause, here, the rule is you can't appeal if there is an immaterial\nchange.\nYou're stuck with the original order.\nAnd, here, we have the district court saying twice in the very orders\nthemselves this is not an immaterial change.\nIt could not have been clearer in stating that and therefore making clear\nto us that the only avenue was to challenge the May order. I also think\nthat that makes sense in the context of this case because my friends on\nthe other side repeatedly told the court that the May order\nencompassed anyone who had simply walked into a kiosk.\nThen, when they sought to amend -- add --have the new August order\nimplemented -- we didn't ask for the August order.\nThey asked for the August order.\nWhen they asked for the new August order, they again told the district\ncourt this is just a housekeeping function, it's not going to change theLABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n22 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nscope of the class.\n### Justice Alito:\nAll right.\nThank -- Thank you.\n### Noel J.

This Court has said that non-named parties\nare parties for some purposes but not for other purposes.\nAnd I know you want us to hold that they must be parties for Article III\npurposes.\nBut, if you step back, do you have -- can you o�er any sort of general\nrule for determining when they must be regarded as parties and when\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nSure.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nI think my basic answer is I -- I don't think that it really matters because\nwhat you're adding are claims to the case.\nWhether you're adding parties or not, their claims are clearly being\nadded to the case, and you're being asked to adjudicate those claims.\nAnd I think that's really what you were getting at in the Laroe case, Your\nHonor, when you said that anytime you add a new claim to the case, you\nhave to have Article III jurisdiction over that claim. And it goes back to\nthe exchange I was having earlier where, if the named plainti�'s case\nbecomes moot and that plainti� drops out as a party, a class action\ncontinues to proceed if there are claims from absent class members over\nwhom the court has Article III jurisdiction.\nSamuel A.

Now the question becomes, in\nnaming that class, will there be people who are blind who didn't want to\nuse it.\nAnd they have to show that there's an administrable way to identify the\ndi�erence between those people and themselves.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI think that's a Rule 23 question.\n### Noel J.

There\nis an argument that if I'm blind, the bene�t that the statute gives me is\nlike the standing question we faced with the ADA person who was\ncalling hotels.\nAnd all she said is I want -- I want to walk in there.\nI may want to use it.LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n26 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nWe didn't require her to use it.\nAll she had to say was I may want to use it.

Francisco:\n27 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nMr. Francisco, hear me out.\nI think the question only becomes pertinent when you're trying to give a\ndamage award to anyone.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nAnd that's where I fundamentally disagree with you, because that's\nonly true if they win. If they lose, if the class is certi�ed and they lose,\nthe entire class is bound by that adverse judgment. So, if you have\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWell, it depends on what ground they lose.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nLet's say they just lose across the board on the merits on a motion to\ndismiss.\nThat binds the entire class. So, if you have certi�ed a class that includes\nuninjured people and the class loses across the board, the general rule is\nthe entire class is bound.\nBut that can't be the case if you didn't have jurisdiction in the �rst place,\nwhich is why jurisdiction always, in every case, precedes the merits.\nIt doesn't follow the merits. That's my -- that's one of our principal\nobjections to their position.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nSonia SotomayorLABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n28 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nBut you're still saying it's a question of predominance and that that's\nwhat has to be addressed.\nIf there's an administrable way to do it, then the class gets certi�ed.\nIf there's not, then you can't.\nSo I'm saying two things.\nUnder Article III, they've got to de�ne the class properly at the front\nend. Under 23(b)(3), I'm not sure I necessarily disagree with you, but\nyou've got to have an administrable way to separate the wheat from the\ncha� before you address the merits, not after you address the merits.\nAnd if the only way to do that consistent with protecting the\ndefendants' rights is thousands of mini-trials, that is necessarily going\nto defeat predominance, just like if the fraud on the market theory fails\nin a way that requires individual issues of reliance. Again, the rule that\nwe're asking for under 23(b)(3) is the one that Judge Katsas adopted in\nthe D.C. Circuit and Judge Kayatta adopted in the First Circuit.",

And that's the key move to get\nyou to a place where it's not the Article III question that's important but\nrather the predominance. Is that right?\n### Noel J.

Francisco:\nAnd -- and was hindered in their ability to -- to -- to check in.\n### Justice Kagan:\nYeah.\nOkay.\nSo -- okay.\nThen we can go back to the procedural question again, which I don't\nwant to do, but, you know, but that does raise the procedural question,\nis like isn't that exactly what the May order said, and the problem was\nreally the August order, which was way wider than that, but the May\norder seems on its face and at least in some of the district courts'\ncomments to be exactly that.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nExcept for when the district court speci�cally addressed it, it explicitly\ntold us there's not an iota worth of di�erence between the two orders\nwhen it comes to the size of the class.\n### Justice Kagan:\nI --I totally can see that it does say that at some times.\nAnd then it says at other times: I'm just talking about people who tried\nto use the kiosk.\nSo that's a little bit of a mystery.\n### Noel J.

Okay.\nBut -- but -- but that's the full range of the Article I question you see,\nand everything else, you're saying, really is a predominance inquiry and\nis a matter -- and -- and I think you said it's not how many people.

Is there\nsomething else that I'm missing?\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nWell, you know, I mean, there have been suggestions that you could just\ndo everything through a�davits and deprive the defendants their right\nof --of contesting those a�davits through the crucible of cross-\nexamination. It's speci�cally what Judge Kayatta addressed in the\nAsacol case, where he said, look, when it comes to issues of preference,\nyou can't simply rely on a�davits because -- unless the defendants\nstand up and say we concede that all of the a�davits are true. Instead, a\ndefendant, if it has a good-faith basis to do so, has a right to contest the\nveracity of a�davits. Here, given how implausible it would be if 112,000\npeople came forward and said we all preferred to use the kiosks, given\nthe inherent implausibility of that, I think we would have a very strong\nbasis to say: No, we want to test every one of those a�davits. We're\ngoing to spend, you know, anywhere between two and 10 yearsLABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n31 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\naddressing the threshold question of jurisdiction, necessarily going to\noverwhelm any common issue.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo you're saying you can't do it by, like, surveys or other mechanisms\nthat address the classes --you know, address -- address the class as a\nwhole.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nThose only work if you could also introduce them in an individual case.\nThat's what you held in Tyson's. But take an individual case like this\none.\nIf somebody came in and said I like kiosks, I want to use the kiosks, you\ncouldn't put forward a survey that says 50 percent of people like to use\nkiosks, therefore, you like to use kiosks.\nThat would be completely inadmissible in an individual case, and so it\nwould be inadmissible in a class case. So what they have to do is identify\nsomething that they could do that's consistent with our right to cross-\nexamine and contest that evidence.\nAnd in a case like this, there's simply no way to do that short of putting\nthese people on the stand and testing whether their assertions fail to\nsurvive the crucible of cross-examination.\n### Justice Kagan:\nOkay.\nThat --that's helpful to me, and I hope that Mr. Gupta addresses the\nsame question.\nI'm sure he will, because what I hear you saying in your argument, again,\naside from the procedural matter as to whether you have any right to\nobject to the May order, is, really, that the -- the crux of the matter is\nsomething along the lines of there's no procedure that we can think of\nthat -- that is easy enough to address the predominance inquiry.\n### Noel J.

Francisco:\nYeah.\n### Justice Kagan:\nseparate people who are injured from people who are uninjured.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nAnd the critical issue I would add to that, Your Honor, is that that is a\nprocedure that also -- always has to be capable of taking place before\nyou reach the merits.\nYou can never kick the jurisdictional question to after you resolve the\nmerits.\nIt's also --always got to be resolved before you reach the merits.\n### Justice Kagan:\nAnd -- and this is only because the -- because you're worried about the\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nI think that just illustrates the nature of the problem.\nI think that just re�ects the fundamental principles of Article III\njurisdiction.LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n33 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nWhen a class action is just an aggregation tool, so when you certify a\nclass, you're adding a bunch of claims to the case.\nYou're increasing the exposure to the defendant.\nYou cannot --you don't have the power to adjudicate the merits of\nthose claims either up or down unless you have jurisdiction over those\nclaims in the �rst place.\n### Justice Kagan:\nYeah, I think this one, I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on\nthis one because the court is not doing anything with respect to those\nclaims until the court actually provides damages, otherwise exercises\nremedial powers with respect to those claims, and as long as the court\n�gures this question out before the court actually does anything with\nrespect to those claims, that seems to me good enough. Otherwise,\nthey're just riding along.\nThey're not -- they're not -- they're not a�ecting the litigation in any\nway.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nSure.\nAnd I disagree with that for a couple of reasons.\nOne is that, as this Court has said a couple of di�erent times, class\nactions are claims aggregation tools.\nAs Justice Scalia explained in Shady Grove, it's just another joinder\ndevice. And I think that the reason why I point to what happens if\nthere's a loss is because it does illustrate that the claims are --it\nillustrates the basic principles that I'm trying to articulate in other ways\nbecause it shows that those claims actually do become part of the case\nat the moment of certi�cation because they are capable of being\nresolved in an adverse way against the defendant. And I think that is\nwhy this Court has always said that class actions are just joinder devices\nno di�erent from intervention.\nAnd Laroe makes clear that if you're going to add that new claim to a\ncase by way of intervention, you need to have jurisdiction over that new\nclaim.\nI don't think there's any di�erent of a rule that would apply in the class\naction context.LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n34 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.\n### Noel J.

I -- I --I believe in response to the Chief Justice, though you\ncan correct me, that you acknowledged that a court can certify a class\naction with some noninjured people in it and that in response to Justice\nKagan, you said basically that you have to do the predominance and\nmanageability inquiry early on.\nThat's -- that's what I got out of it.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nAnd then you determine whether you can separate the wheat from the\ncha� early on in order to ensure that you can weed out people who\naren't injured.\nAnd if all that's true --and you can tell me where I'm wrong -- boy, that\nsure sounds like Rule 23 to me.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nSo, Your Honor, I think I wasn't clear if that's how you understood my\narticulation of the rule.\nThere are sort of two steps.\nThere's the Article III step and the 23(b)(3) step.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nYou need to de�ne the class so that it's limited only --only to injuredLABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n35 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\npeople.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nOnly --so you can never have an uninjured person in a class de�nition?\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nBut I think that in a case like this and in most cases, that can be solved\npretty easily.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nOkay, I -- I've heard all that before.\nI don't mean to force you to repeat it.\nSo your position now is a class de�nition can never have one uninjured\nperson in it?\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nIf I can imagine a de�nition that -- that yields one uninjured person, I\ncan't certify it?\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nWell, if you can imagine a class de�nition that yields one uninjured\nperson, you can rede�ne the class to eliminate that uninjured person.LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n36 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWell, maybe I can and maybe I can't, but I know that common issues\npredominate and I know that I can sort out those things later, and I still\ncan't certify it? Is that your position?\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nI think what you do, what the proper approach there would be, to simply\nrede�ne the class to eliminate the one person.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nYou can say, okay, the class includes everybody but that one person.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nSo I think the answer is -- I think the answer to the question is yes.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nYes.\nYes.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nYou cannot certify that class at -- at all.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nYes.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nOkay.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nBut you can rede�ne.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nAnd if that's true, is that protective of defendants' rights? I mean, we've\nbeen talking about judgments in class action litigation.\nMy memory's a little hazy, but I remember doing a little -- a little bit of\nit back in the day.\nAnd these things never go to judgment.LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n37 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nThey're always settled. And often defendants like broad class\nde�nitions because it gives them peace.\nAnd the alternative, which I think your rule would invite, is mass tort\nclaims in which you're litigating these -- you talk about piecemeal.\nYou're really going to be litigating it piecemeal.\nThoughts?\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nSo I guess my �rst thought would be, if you look at, just as a practical\nmatter, are the positions that we're articulating pro-defendant or anti-\ndefendant, I guess my �rst answer would be I don't think it really\nmatters.\nBut my second answer would be that to the extent it does, I'm pretty\ncomfortable with my position from a pro-defense standpoint because,\nif you look who's lined up in favor of our position, it's pretty much the\nentire defense bar. Then, to take it on more directly, what I'd say is, if\nyou can properly de�ne the class, the case can be easily settled.\nYou just have to �gure out who's in that class and settle it with respect\nto those people. I think that the problem when you can lard up a class\nnot just with one, not just with two uninjured members, but you can\nde�ne a class in a way like this one that maybe includes as many as a\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWell, now then -- then --then you'd maybe have some predominance\nissues and some manageability issues, and I --I take all that point.\nBut that's what Rule 23 exists to sort out.\nAnd maybe it isn't certi�able for that reason.\nBut that's a Rule 23 inquiry, it seems to me.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nAnd that's the second part of our argument, Your Honor.\n### Noel J. FranciscoLABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...:\n38 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nthe merits, short of having all of the mini-trials, it's going to fail under\n23(b)(3)(ii).\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nOkay.\nYeah.\nThank you.\n### Noel J.

Francisco:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAll right.\nI hear you saying at bottom that it violates Article III to include\nuninjured people in the class de�nition and that it violates Rule 23 if\nthere are lots of uninjured people in the class de�nition.LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n46 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nAnd so if I can just ask you questions about those two di�erent basic\npropositions that I think is really what is underpinning your arguments\nhere. The problem that I keep coming back to with your Article III point,\nthat it violates the Constitution to include uninjured people in the class\nand so you would, therefore, need to rede�ne it to be only injured\npeople, is our standard rules and principles with respect to standing and\nwhen the jurisdiction of the Court can be invoked. My understanding is\nthat you --you only need one plainti�, one plainti�, who establishes\nstanding, even if there are others there who are making the same claim.\nI appreciate that our law says if they're making di�erent claims by\nnature.\nI mean, obviously, they're di�erent because there are di�erent people\nthere. But what we say is, if there's a claim that is being made and the\nclaim is you violated the law in this way and we have �ve people who are\nsaying that and they are named plainti�s in this action, only one of\nthem has to establish injury for standing purposes. If that's true, I don't\nunderstand your Article III argument.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nSo I would push back on whether or not that is true. This Court has never\napplied the one-plainti� rule to a damages case, which I think because,\nby de�nition, in a damages case, every plainti� is seeking his own form\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd we've done that at the threshold? I mean, my understanding is that\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nThat's Laroe.\n### Justice Jackson:\nNo, what -- what -- what I -- my understanding is that, yes, at the end\nof the day, each person has to have been injured in order to be entitled to\ndamages. But, for the invocation of the power of the court, which is\nwhat Article III standing is about, we don't go into the harm to each\nperson in order to take up the claim that is being made.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nSure.LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n47 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\n### Justice Jackson:\nAll right.\n### Justice Jackson:\nOkay.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nWhat Laroe speci�cally said was that at the point of intervention, you\ndon't allow the intervenor to add his new claim to the case unless he can\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut I'm not talking about intervention.\nI'm talking about original action.\nWe have �ve plainti�s.\nThey are making a claim.\nThey have one count in their complaint.\nAnd I understood that many, many times we just say: One person, show\nus your harm.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nNever in a damages case have you ever done that, Your Honor.\n### Justice Jackson:\nOkay.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nOnly in injunctions, and even there, only where plainti�s were seeking\n### Justice Jackson:\nAll right.\n### Noel J. FranciscoLABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...:\n48 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\n### Justice Jackson:\nThe second problem is with respect to the proposition that it violates\nRule 23 if there are lots of uninjured people in the class, and I got to tell\nyou I'm struggling with why it matters that there are uninjured people. I\nhear you say that the reason is because we have to have a bunch of mini-\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Jackson:\ntherefore, that might be a problem with your argument. So suppose we\nhave a Verizon customer who brings a class action against the company,\narguing that Verizon charged her and all customers certain fees over a\nsix-month time period that she says were unlawful.\nAnd this is a claim that does not have an element of harm in it.\nShe's just saying these fees, unlawful, you weren't allowed to do it.\nAnd she seeks to certify a class of all Verizon customers during that six-\nmonth time frame. Now imagine that Verizon says that it only charged\nsome of its customers during that six-month time frame the relevant\nfee.\nSo, in actuality, only some of the members of the de�ned class were\ninjured.\nAnd Verizon says that, over time, with some e�ort, it can generate a list\nof those customers.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo, at the class certi�cation stage, everybody knows that we will\neventually be able to �gure out which customers were actually charged\nthe fee.\nBut we have a class that's de�ned of everybody --LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n49 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nSure.\n### Justice Jackson:\nmatters how many injured versus noninjured members there are in this\nclass as de�ned.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nYeah.\nI think the way that the resolution of that hypothetical would proceed\nwas, at the front end, if you know that you've got a class that includes\nboth people who were charged the fee and people who were not charged\nthe fee, you de�ne the class to include only people who were charged\nthe fee.\nThat solves the Article III problem.\n### Justice Jackson:\nWell, assuming -- assuming there is an Article III problem.\n### Justice Jackson:\nOkay.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nYeah, right, assuming it is an Article -- I totally --I totally agree with\nthat.\n### Justice Jackson:\nRight.\nOkay.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nThen you get to the second stage, and you do the Rule 23(b)(3) analysis\nand you say --and it's not really -- as I mentioned to the Chief Justice,\nit's not so much a numbers game.\nThe question is, is it easy to �gure out --LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n50 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nAnd, in your hypothetical, it might well be very easy to �gure it out.\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo we do certify that class or we don't?\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut why? What di�erence does it make?\n### Justice Jackson:\nWhat -- what di�erence does it make when we're certifying this class to\nestablish the liability, there are common issues with respect to that,\nand, really, the only thing that �guring out who is harmed and not\nmatters to is who gets damages at the end of the day?\n### Justice Jackson:\nI don't understand why class certi�cation would be held up or evaluated\nwith respect to, you know, the numbers of people who were actually\ninjured or not in the class.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nSure.\nAnd with respect, Your Honor, I think it makes all the di�erence in the\nworld from both a practical matter and a legal matter. From a practical\nmatter, these bloated classes are what allow plainti�s' lawyers to\nextract massive settlements on weak claims. From a legal matter, what\nyou are doing are adding claims to a case over whom the Court doesn'tLABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n51 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nhave jurisdiction.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAssuming your Article III question is correct.\n### Noel J. Francisco:\nNo, no, no, no.\nNo. Even assuming my Article III question is wrong, Your Honor. If you\nhave a class that includes people who have not been injured -- I'll\nassume that you don't think that that is an Article III problem.\nWhen it comes to Rule 23(b)(3), you still at some point have to �gure out\nwhether or not you have jurisdiction over those individual claims.\nAnd you cannot proceed to adjudicate the merits of those individual\n### Justice Jackson:\nAll right.\n### Justice Jackson:\nOne �nal question on the -- assuming the claim is di�erent from other\nclaims, but -- but setting that aside, with respect to the practicality of\nit, I appreciate",

If\nyou're a necessary party, you de�nitely have su�ered an injury.\nAnd the representative action was meant to say it might be di�cult to\nget all of those injured people, those necessary parties, joined, and so\nhere's an exception we can create.

And we basically said\nyou can't give out the damages to the people who weren't injured\nbecause there was no dissemination.\nBut that wasn't known until the end. I think what Mr. Francisco is now\nsaying, and I'm not sure you are or aren't, that now we have to have that\n�ght at the class certi�cation stage, that we have to de�ne a class in a\nway that says only people who receive the report instead of the way it\nwas de�ned.

And so the courts are trying to �gure out do\nwe have, you know, a new order granting or denying certi�cation.\nAnd, in this case, I think it's quite clear -- and, actually, I disagree with\nMr. Joshi's characterization.\nI think it's quite clear that the May order and the August order are\ndi�erent orders with respect to class certi�cation. In fact, the August\norder, it's true that it -- it says it's modifying the previous order.\nThat was the June order, which the Ninth Circuit also said was outside of\nits jurisdiction.LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n76 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, suppose the district court issues a -- a --an order certifying a\nclass.\nThere is an appeal.\nAnd, after that, the district court makes some change in the order, but\nthe district court says, look, this is not material.\nThis is immaterial, absolutely immaterial.\n### Deepak Gupta:\nRight.\n### Justice Alito:\nWhat --what is the -- the party who's taken the earlier appeal\nsupposed to do?

Even though the district court has said it's\nimmaterial, I'm going to have to take -- I'm going to have to �le a new\nnotice of appeal always.\n### Deepak Gupta:\nRight.\nSo I think that's exactly what this doctrine is intended to address.\nAnd I think, you know, if -- if there was a typographical error, for\nexample, in a class certi�cation order, I think nobody would reasonably\ninsist that there needs to be a second 23(f) petition.\nAnd I think Judge Posner has a -- a decision on this in the Apple Illinois\ncase.

And they cite in their reply brief the Jacksonville case.\nThat case is a case about an exception for mootness, but it is about the\nvoluntary cessation and capable of repetition exception, which is a\nrecognized exception.\n### Justice Alito:\nIf the -- I --I don't want to belabor this, but I will ask one more question\non it. If the -- the Ninth Circuit's rule is not required by statute, then\nwhy is there a jurisdictional problem?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nOh, I think that the -- the court of appeals have to have some way of\ndetermining what is within their jurisdiction and what is not.\nAnd remember it's discretionary, so they have certiorari-like discretion\n### Deepak Gupta:\nRight.\n### Justice Alito:\ndecision say we --we are de�ning our jurisdiction in a particular way?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nWell, I think they -- they exercised their discretion with respect to a\norder granting or denying class certi�cation.

Recall that they sold --theyLABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n80 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nyou've got unscrupulous plainti�s' lawyer --lawyers that are stu�ng\nclasses full of uninjured people, right? But they regarded that �rst\nde�nition, the problem with it is that it was actually too tethered to the\nplainti�s' injury, that it -- that it was failsafe because it only had\nuninjured people.\nAnd then they regarded the second de�nition as broader and -- and\nwanted to challenge that de�nition. So, under those circumstances, I do\nnot think it would be reasonable for somebody to rely on the idea that\nthe original 23(f) petition didn't extend. But -- but we're now here\ntalking about, you know, the appealability of that --of that order.\nAnd that jurisdictional holding wasn't challenged.\nAnd I actually read the reply and the letters that were exchanged as\nacknowledging that Labcorp hasn't preserved and isn't seeking to\ncontest that jurisdictional holding of the court of appeals. So now what\nyou're left with is an appeal from an order that has been superseded.\nAnd I alluded earlier to the general rule.\nThe general rule in this Court's cases -- and this comes up when you\nhave, for example, a preliminary injunction that has been outstripped\nand then you had an appeal from the preliminary injunction.\nThis Court has said those appeals are moot.\nOr, if you have, for example, an appeal with respect to a complaint, the\ncomplaint has been amended, the interlocutory appeal is rendered\nmoot.\nYou might have a --a case in a redistricting case where there's a debate\nabout a map, and then the map has been changed.\nThat appeal would be rendered moot. And so that's the general rule.\nAnd that's why I said earlier that what I regard Labcorp as asking you to\ndo is to craft an exception from that general rule on mootness for this\ncircumstance. And I think I regard them as relying on this material\nchange doctrine from the lower courts as supplying a standard for that\nmootness exception.\nMr. Francisco can correct me if I'm wrong, but that's how we read their\nreply brief and the letter.\nAnd I think, you know, in our view, that would be an ill-advised thing to\ndo. You don't have brie�ng on that.

It is also important that the court of appeals be able to use their\nlimited resources to exercise their discretion to decide live controversies\nwith respect to actual, in e�ect class certi�cation orders, rather than\nhave appeals that are, you know, backwards-looking and are about a\ntarget that has already moved.",

Tyson Foods was a --a case\nthat came here where you had a complex question about how to weed\nout the uninjured people.\nAnd because the defendant hadn't kept records, the plainti�s had to\nrely on expert testimony.\nAnd there were 212 people at that pork processing plant in Storm Lake,LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n86 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nIowa, who it turned out were not injured. It would have been really easy\nto have a trial and weed them out if there had been a special\ninterrogatory form.\nThose were people who were uninjured simply because, you know, they\ndidn't work over 40 hours and so they weren't deprived of overtime.\nBut, if you -- you --you accept the -- the submission on the other side\nhere today, I think what should have happened, in their view, is rede�ne\nAnd then you would have had a failsafe problem perhaps, which is you\nwould have de�ned the class to be only those people who worked 40\nhours and were not paid overtime.\nThat's not really in the Defendants' interest.

You say the job is to weed out the uninjured.\nI think Mr. Francisco says you have to do that at the start by virtue of\nArticle III and Rule 23. And the government joins him with respect to the\nsecond point of that. You seem to say it su�ces just to know that there\nis going to be a mechanism to do that down the road eventually.\nWhy is he wrong about the timing of this?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nYeah.\nI --I do think it's a question of timing.\nAnd I think, if we're analyzing this from the perspective of Article III,\nthis Court has always said that the case or controversy between the\nplainti�s in a class action and the defendants is between the named\nplainti�, the representative party. That's the person that's the party.\nSo, if you think about this from the perspective of what Justice Story said\nabout how representative litigation worked at equity practice or how it\nworks under modern Rule 23, Justice Scalia's opinion in Devlin, the\nunderstanding has always been that, pretty much always, the absentees\nare not parties over whom the court exercises jurisdiction unless and\nuntil the court is doing one of two things: exercising its remedial power\nwith respect to an absentee or deciding a question that it wouldn't\notherwise have to decide, like an individual question. At that point, we\nacknowledge that those people who are absentees, they then have to\nestablish Article III standing.\n### Justice Jackson:\nWhat about Rule 23?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nBut why should you do all this before you have to? That's one of the\ne�ciencies of the class device.\nAnd I think Rule 23 is designed to promote those e�ciencies through\nrepresentative litigation so long as you have a case or controversy with a\nrepresentative.LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n95 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nThe way it works now is really the way it worked in Anglo-American\ncourts at the time of the -- the founding, is that you -- you decide the\ncommon questions with respect to the person who is actually before the\ncourt, and then, if and only if there's a --they prevail, then the people\ncan come in under the decree. That was the language that Justice Story\nused, and it's the same language that Rule 23 uses. But why would you\ndecide all of that, those individualized questions, if you don't have to,\nbecause the defendant is actually going to prevail. And this brings me to\none point that --that I just want to mention if I have time, which is that\nthere's a suggestion on the �rst page of the reply brief that if you\nadopted our rule, that -- that what's going to happen is you're not\ngoing to have preclusive class judgments. And I actually think this is a\nbig bug with their approach and -- and a feature of ours, which is right\nnow a defendant can rest easy knowing that they've prevailed in a class\naction and someone isn't going to run into state court and bring the\nexact same claim and say, a-ha, we didn't -- we wouldn't have had\nArticle III standing in that �rst case.\nAnd that disturbs the �nality of class-wide judgments. Class-wide\njudgments and their �nality and their preclusive e�ect under our\ncurrent law is predicated on adequate representation and due process.\nAnd I think you would be breaking the system if you were to adopt their\nposition that makes Article III a necessary prerequisite and -- and\ninvites collateral attacks and retrospective inquiries into the �nality of\nclass judgments.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThank you.",

FranciscoLABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...:\n96 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice. To begin with the procedural issue, here's\nwhat the district court said twice: In re�ning the class de�nition, this\norder does not materially alter the composition of the class or materially\nchange in any manner the original de�nition of the class. Here's what\nplainti�s argued to the district court when it urged the district court to\nadopt the August de�nition.\nIt moved to to recline -- to re�ne the class de�nition, and it assured the\ncourt that it was \"identical in every way to the original May de�nition.\"\nAnd it assured it that it had not changed the \"substance\" of the class.\nThat's at page 107 of the district court's docket, pages 3 and 7. Now\nthere is a reason for that.\nThe de�nition, the original May de�nition, was de�ned to include any\nblind person who was denied full and equal enjoyment of the goods,\nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations due to\nLabcorp's failure to have accessible kiosks. Their position with respect\nto that language was the position that my friend just articulated.\nEvery single person who walked into a Labcorp facility had those rights\ndenied regardless of whether they wanted to use a kiosk or not.\nThat's what he just stood up and told you was their understanding of\nwho's injured, and that �ts within that de�nition. That is why they took\nthe position that the August de�nition and the May de�nition were the\nsame.\nThat is why the district court took the position that the August\nde�nition and the May de�nitions were the same, because the district\ncourt agreed that that was what the de�nition of the class and the class\nof people who would have had standing, and perhaps, most\nimportantly, that is why the Ninth Circuit resolved the question\npresented. It acknowledged that it couldn't address an issue that\npertained solely to the August order, but because, on the issue that it\ndid resolve, there was not a --an iota of di�erence between the May\norder and the August order for the reasons my friend explained to you\nwhen he was standing up here, it did resolve that question. That it\nreduced to a judgment.\nThat judgment is before you.\nYou plainly have jurisdiction to resolve that question presented. Turning\nto the merits, I think that the -- as we discussed, the Article III issue is\neasy to solve, but it walks right into the 23(b)(3) question.LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, ... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n97 of 98 22/08/2025, 00:25\nMy friend essentially acknowledged that when it comes to a class loss,\nthe only consequence is that you're going to end up binding a class even\nif it includes members over whom the Court lacked jurisdiction. That is a\nfairly shocking proposition. To say that a court can say I know I am\nadjudicating a whole group of people, many of whom I don't have\njurisdiction over, yet, nonetheless, I am going to proceed to bind them\nwith that judgment, that is in the teeth of Steel Company, we ask that\nyou reverse.\n\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you, counsel.
