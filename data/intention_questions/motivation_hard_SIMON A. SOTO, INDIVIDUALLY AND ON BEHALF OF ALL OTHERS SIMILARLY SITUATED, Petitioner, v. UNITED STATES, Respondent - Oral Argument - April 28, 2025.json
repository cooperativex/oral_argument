  "background": "Simon Soto, a Marine Corps veteran with a combat-related disability, was medically retired in 2006 with less than 20 years of service. Although he became eligible for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) in 2009 when he received his disability rating, he did not apply until 2016. The Navy used the Barring Act’s six-year limitation period to calculate his retroactive payments, giving him payments dating back only to 2010 instead of to 2008 when Congress had expanded CRSC eligibility to veterans with less than 20 years of service. Soto filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of himself and other similarly situated veterans who received only six years of back payments, arguing that the CRSC statute’s own procedures should apply instead of the Barring Act’s six-year limit. The district court granted summary judgment to Soto’s class, holding that the CRSC statute was more specific and therefore superseded the Barring Act. The court also applied the pro-veteran canon of statutory interpretation, resolving any doubt in favor of the veterans. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed.",

Indeed, that's true of the statutes governing the death gratuity\nbene�t, which Petitioner has agreed in his reply brief and I believe my\nfriend agreed today would convey independent settlement authority\nunder his test.\nBut we know that can't be right because then Congress's recent\namendment of the death gratuity statute to provide a time limit\napplicable only to miners would be inexplicable. That illustrates that\nPetitioner's function-based standard does not capture congressional\nintent and threatens destabilizing results. I welcome the Court's\nquestions.",

The statute authorizes determination of eligibility.\nIt authorizes determination of amount due.\nSo what's missing? I think the answer I heard was a hallmark\nformulation.\nWe agree it doesn't have to be the word \"settle,\" but it has to be a\nhallmark formulation.\nAnd then my friend read examples of words that, in the government's\nview, sound \"hallmark\" enough.\nAs Justice Jackson's questions aptly call out, I don't know what counts\nas a hallmark formulation.\nThe way that this Court has instructed to read statutes is read the words\nthat are written in the statute.\nDon't say there's a small group, one or, you know, about a dozen, I think\nit was, acceptable terms, and if Congress uses these terms, okay, and if\nit doesn't use these terms, then we're not going to interpret the statute\nto have settlement authority.\nThat's not how this Court has read statutes.\nThe Court rejected a very similar argument in Lac du Flambeau about\nwhether the Bankruptcy Code abrogated tribal sovereign immunity.\nThe argument was that other statutes had made express reference toSIMON A. SOTO, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF A... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n46 of 48 22/08/2025, 00:01\ntribal sovereign immunity, and the Court said Congress is entitled to do\nit di�erently this time.\nThat might be the more --most straightforward way. That might be\narguably the most obvious way to abrogate tribal sovereign immunity.\nBut that doesn't mean Congress is foreclosed from doing it using\ndi�erent terms.\nThe same here.\nMaybe hallmark formulations, \"settlement\" or otherwise, would be the\nmost obvious, most straightforward way to write the CRSC statute, but\nthat sure doesn't mean it's the only way.\nThe way to interpret Section 1413a is to read its text to determine\nwhether it authorizes an o�cial to determine the validity of CRSC\nclaims and the amount due, and all of that is there in the statute.\nNow, to talk about the other statutes that my friend has referred to, of\ncourse, we started in the briefs with a few or more dozen. We're down to\nmay be implicated by application of our test.\nWe've only found two, as --the same as your law clerk, Justice\nSotomayor.\nLook, maybe these statutes do displace the Barring Act.\nIf a statute has language that authorizes an o�cial to determine the\nvalidity of claims and the amount due, it is proper to conclude that the\nBarring Act is displaced, because Section 3702(a) says: If another\nstatute provides for settlement of claims, this law doesn't apply.\nA statute that authorizes an to determine the validity and amount due\non claims is a statute that authorizes settlement. That is just the\nde�nition of \"settlement\" that this Court said was well-established as\nof 1916 and nobody thinks has changed in the intervening years.\nSo, if there is one, two, or six military statutes that courts will have to\nread as a result of a victory for Corporal Soto here, that is perfectly\nappropriate.\nAnd that prospect certainly doesn't support not reading the text of\nSection 1413a literally because of concerns that it might give rise to, you\nknow, more lawsuits in connection with six or seven other statutes, or\ntwo.\nTo address brie�y the retired pay question that you asked, JusticeSIMON A. SOTO, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF A... https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/roberts13/oral_argument_...\n47 of 48 22/08/2025, 00:01\nBarrett, of course, we did argue below that we don't think that this case\ninvolves retired pay.\nThe Federal Circuit disagreed with that.\nI mean, that --I -- I don't think there could be any more hallmark or\nclear formulation of the statement that CRSC is not retired pay.\nThat is the words in subsection (g) of 1413a.\nThat is a pretty obvious way to conclude that Section 3702(a)(1) does\nnot apply, because this is a bene�t that is not retired pay, so\ndetermination of claims involving this bene�t are not determinations\ninvolving retired pay.\nAnd that would certainly alleviate any other concerns, although, of\ncourse, we do recognize, as my friend did, that that's not part of the\nquestion presented as reformulated by this Court.\nJust to address very brie�y the death gratuity statute that my friend\nmentioned and the statute of limitations, I respectfully take issue with\nMs. Flynn's reading of the death gratuity statute.\nSection 1479, which is the provision which we have read as potentially\nauthorizing settlement, that relates only to immediate payment of\ndeath gratuities under Section 1475.
