  "background": "On April 28, 2016, Officer Roberto Felix Jr. fatally shot Ashtian Barnes during a traffic stop on the Harris County Tollway. After spotting Barnes’s Toyota Corolla, which had been flagged for toll violations, Felix initiated a stop and Barnes pulled over to the median. When Felix requested documentation, Barnes, who was driving a car rented in his girlfriend’s name, could not produce it and began “digging around” in the car. Claiming he smelled marijuana, Felix questioned Barnes, who then turned off the vehicle and suggested checking the trunk for documentation. Dash cam footage shows that after Barnes opened the trunk and exited the vehicle at Felix’s request, the car’s blinker came back on and the vehicle began to move. Felix, with his weapon drawn, stepped onto the moving car and pressed his gun against Barnes’s head. While holding onto the car frame with his head above the roof—leaving him unable to see inside the vehicle—Felix fired two shots. Barnes’s vehicle stopped, and he was pronounced dead at the scene at 2:57 p.m. Though both the Houston Police Department and Harris County Precinct 5 Constable's Office investigated the incident, a grand jury found no probable cause for an indictment. \n The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, focusing exclusively on the two seconds before the shooting when Barnes’s car began moving with Felix holding onto it. The court ruled that because Felix reasonably feared for his life in that moment, his use of deadly force was justified regardless of his previous actions, such as jumping onto the moving vehicle. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.",

If he had not -- if he had not used\ndeadly force, but he had jumped on the side of the car and done\neverything else he did prior to that moment, would there be a violation\nof the Fourth Amendment?\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nSo, Justice Alito, we had brought a predicate claim below about the\ndrawing of the firearm.\nMy friends on the other side have suggested we should have brought a\npredicate claim based on the jumping onto the car.\nBut, at the end of the day, I don't think that it matters whether there is a\npredicate claim because, in the -- let me give you an analogy.\nIn the search context, you have an obligation to knock before you\nsearch.\nThere's no freestanding requirement under the Fourth Amendment if\nyou're an officer standing outside a door to knock.\nBut, if you are going to engage in a search, we evaluate the\nreasonableness of that search by looking a couple seconds before, did\nyou knock? here.\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nIt's the same thing\n### Justice Alito:\nThe reason for the question is to probe whether you are using the term\n\"unreasonable\" in a sense that's different from the sense in which the\nFourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. So\n\"unreasonable\" has a particular meaning when the Court has to decide\nwhether there was a Fourth Amendment violation.\nBut, in lay speech, \"unreasonable\" could go to whether the action was\nprudent, whether it was a violation of best police practices or the\npractices of a particular police department.\nThose are not necessarily the same thing.\nIn fact, it seems that they're probably different.\nSo you are eliding these two different meanings of \"reasonable.\" Now\nmaybe that's -- maybe that's sound.\nMaybe that's unsound.\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nJustice Alito, what we're asking for is the standard that this Court has\napplied in Garner, Graham, and Scott and Plumhoff, which is you have to\nlook at the -- the balance here.\nThere's, on the one side, the state interest in seizing someone in a\nparticular manner.\nOn the other side, there is the harm to the suspect, here, the ultimate\nharm, the loss of his life. The problem in this case is that the Fifth Circuit\ncouldn't engage in that core balancing because it couldn't ask was there\na really pressing reason for an officer to jump onto a car and give himself\nno other opportunity but to shoot the driver.\n### Justice Alito:\nit is wrong for a court to look just at the moment of the threat, that the\ncourt has to judge the reasonableness of the alleged unreasonable\nseizure based on -- taking into account to whatever extent they are\nrelevant the events that occurred before that? Would you be satisfied if\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nOne hundred percent.\nI think it would be helpful if the Court makes clear that that means that\nyou can look at the jump in addition to the shoot, right? That's the core\nissue that we want to be able to litigate.\nBut, yes, Justice Alito, we'd be happy with a very narrow holding.",

Or are you asking the court or the jury\nto determine whether the whole course of conduct in which the officer is\nengaged was unreasonable, in part in the sense that it wasn't prudent, it\nwas in violation of perhaps departmental policies or the best practices\nthat had been established for police department -- that --that some\npeople think should be followed by police departments around the\ncountry? That -- that's really the difficult question, and what -- what\nwould you say to that?\n### Zoe A. Jacoby:\nI would say, Justice Alito, the former.\nThe question is: Was the use of force, the seizure, reasonable in the\nmoment? That's what we're trying to get at when we look at the totality\nof circumstances.\nWe're not doing some sort of freewheeling inquiry into whether the\nofficer overall, over the course of five minutes, acted reasonably.\nSo -- so that is why we think the circumstances in the moment do have\nprime importance.\nBut that does not mean that courts have a license to ignore everything\nbefore that moment, as the Fifth Circuit did here.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, would it be -- would a court hearing this case be obligated to\nadmit expert testimony by various individuals who have a view about\nwhat are good police practices and what are not good police practices?\nWould the -- would that be what the jury's determination would boil\ndown to?\n### Zoe A. Jacoby:\nSo the ultimate determination here about whether the officer acted\nreasonably is, according to Scott, a pure question of law.\nThe jury's not deciding that.\nThe jury could be making factual determinations about what actually\nhappened, you know, when the officer jumped and -- and all the rest.\nAs the Court is examining whether that initial thing that the officer did\nhere, jumping on the car, was outside the bounds of reasonable\nbehavior, I do think it's appropriate to look at training manuals and the\nlike.\nThat can't resolve the question, but that could provide helpful\nguidance.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, there are federal -- there are some federal law enforcement\nofficers who make vehicle stops.\nSo what is the -- the teaching? Do you know? What --what are they\ntaught about placing themselves in front of the car or in a position\nwhere they could be killed or injured if the driver decides to try to drive\naway?\n### Zoe A. Jacoby:\nI don't know across the board a rule for stepping in front of cars.\nI know that federal officers are trained to use force to respond to danger\nbut not to enter into situations where the use of force becomes sort of\ninevitable.\nThat's like the DHS manual that my friend points to at page 41 of her\nbrief.\nI think, again, we don't really train officers to go right up to the\nconstitutional line.\nWe often will train officers to not enter in these situations to begin with\neven if -- if they ultimately do so, it could end up being not a Fourth\nAmendment violation.\nSo I suspect we would train officers not to -- you know, to frequently\navoid using force on roads and whatnot, even if it would be permissible\nunder the circumstances to do so, because we just want to -- to train\nthem more cautiously, I suspect.\n### Justice Alito:\nThank you.",

Pettit:\nI believe that's what they're referring to when they say these actions\nthat you're talking to are irrelevant.\n### Justice Jackson:\nWell, what is -- what is Judge Higginbotham saying when he says in his\nconcurrence: I write separately to express my concern with the circuit's\nmoment of the threat doctrine.\nAnd then he doesn't d efine it in the way that you have.\nHe says: This doctrine counters the Supreme Court's instructions to look\nat the totality of the circumstances.\n### Lanora C. Pettit:\nYour Honor, I would point your --you to page 15A of his opinion, where\nhe also says that: In our reasonableness analysis, references to our\nsupposed obligation to consider the totality of circumstances are\nmerely performative.\nSo the dispute here appears to be not the formulation of the rule as I\narticulated it but its application.\n### Justice Jackson:\nNo, he says it's performative --you didn't read the first part of the\nsentence -- if the moment of the threat is the sole determinative factor\nin our reasonableness analysis.\nSo he says: We have a moment of the threat doctrine that tells us we\nonly look at this moment.\nAnd what that does is it makes any references to totality merely\nperformative because we're not looking at the totality, we're just\nlooking at the moment of the threat.\nSo do you dispute that at least he conceptualized the doc -- the doctrine\nin the way that I'm describing and the way that Petitioners have put it\nforward?\n### Lanora C. Pettit:\nThere are certainly statements to that effect.\nHe has, for -- however, created a very similar concurrence in a case\n### Justice Jackson:\nNo, I'm talking about this case.\nSo let me --let me -- let me tell you what I think is happening, and I just\nwant to get your reaction and then I'll be done.\nIt seems as though the question presented here is asking us to decide\nwhich test the courts should apply, and it sees the moment of the threat\ndoctrine as different, distinct, from the totality of the circumstances.\nWhich test? The Fifth Circui t applied moment of the threat.\nIs that right or wrong? It seems now that you are arguing which\ncircumstances, assuming totality, is it okay to include or consider the c\nircumstance of the officer's own conduct.\nYou know, if courts are doing that, is that a problem? That is a separate\nquestion that is not, I think, properly within the scope of the question\npresented, which just asks us which test.\nSo can you help me to understand why we would get into whether or not\nthe particular circumstance you've identified is one that courts should\nbe looking at or not?\n### Lanora C. Pettit:\nBecause I agree with my -- my colleague that it is difficult to answer the\nquestion -- the question presented without getting into that.\nAnd I would point this Court to pages 15, 23, 28, 32, and 41 to 42 of the\nPetitioner's opening brief in which they are discussing precisely this\ntype of question.\nSo, while they claim to disclaim it, they actually are talking about\ncreation of the risk.\nIn fact, in responding to questions from Justice Alito and",

Just let him go?\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nNo, Justice Kavanaugh. I think there are a number of other options that\nwere available to Officer Felix that day.\nLet me give you four. First, the highway was a camera -controlled\nhighway.\nSo you can monitor all the cars by camera.\nThat's, in fact, how Ashtian Barnes was pulled over in the first place.\nThe cameras automatically identified his car as one with unpaid tolls.\nSecond, he could have radioed to somebody else on the road to follow\nAshtian Barnes.\nThird, he could have gotten back into his squad car and followed him.\nAnd, fourth, they also had the car's license plate.\nSo we're not suggesting that somebody should just get away scot-free,\nbut it is unreasonable to use deadly force because what happened was\nOfficer Felix put himself in a position where he had no alternative but to\nshoot the driver.\nAnd that's unreasonable, and you have to look at the whole picture, not\njust the two seconds in which he's on the car.",

Zelinsky:\nI think that the -- there are a series of reoccurring fact patterns. I think\nthere are two of them.\nI think that the jumping in front of or onto car does occur with some\nfrequency.\nSo we cited in our reply brief a study of 400 stops that found that there\nis a routine problem of officers jumping in front of cars --in the article,\nit's described \"in a Hollywood style\" -- and then shooting the driver.\nThe other reoccurring fact pattern is a pattern where officers fail to\nidentify themselves, and the suspect, exercising his or her own Second\nAmendment rights to self -defense, pulls out a firearm.\nThe Fifth Circuit alone has two cases in which they apply the moment of\nthe threat doctrine.\nThe cases are Cass and Royal.\nAnd they say: We can't look at the fact that the officer failed to identify\nhimself.\nWe can only look at the fact that the officer faced a loaded gun.\nAnd that, by the way, is just sharply inconsistent with how the common\nlaw approached the exact same circumstance.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nOn the jumping in front of the car, I think you said this earlier, but\nsometimes it'll be reasonable and sometimes not?\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nSo, yeah, let me give you an example maybe where it might be\nreasonable just to help flesh it out. Take the tragic terrorist attack in\nNew Orleans.\nIn that particular case, someone used a car as a weapon of terror.\nIf an officer had jumped in front of the car and shot the driver, that\nofficer would be a hero, and it's because the state interest in that case in\nseizing that terrorist is incredibly high.\nAgain, that's the type of balancing that the Fifth Circuit just couldn't\nengage in in this case.",

So I would just direct the\nCourt to the Harris v. Serpas case, and that's quoted by Judge\nHigginbotham in his decision below.\nIn Harris, the Fifth Circuit goes out of its way to say this Court has\nnarrowed that test, and \"that test\" is referring to the Graham test.\nThey are self-consciously clear that they are narrowing this Court's\nprecedent.\nAnd the court then goes on to say any of the officer's actions leading up\nto the shooting are not relevant for the purposes of an excessive force\ninquiry in this circuit.\nSo that's a categorical bar.\nAnd then the third point is that in this case, you don't just have Judge\nHigginbotham who's describing the split or the -- the moment of the\nthreat doctrine; you also have Judge Elrod and Judge Smith who sign on\nto that panel decision, and all of them agree this is how the doctrine\noperates in the Fifth Circuit.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThank you.",

Of course.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd can I just clarify that the United States is not taking a position on\nthe facts of this case and whether or not Officer Felix used reasonable\nforce, and, in fact, you would be satisfied with just a clarification that\n\"moment of the threat\" doctrine i s not what courts should be using,\nand then sending it back to the Fifth Circuit for the Fourth Amendment\nanalysis in this situation?\n### Zoe A. Jacoby:\nThat's absolutely correct.\nOur interest in this dispute is a narrow one.\nWe're really just interested in correcting the Fifth Circuit's legal error.\nAnd -- and we have no position on the facts of this case.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThank you.",

McCloud:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When an\nofficer doing his duty confronts a threat to his safety or the safety of\nothers, it is reasonable for that officer to use force to end that threat.\nThat's the conclusion this Court has consistently reached, and that's\nwhat the Fifth Circuit correctly held below.\nAt the moment Sergeant Felix used force, he was clinging to the side of a\nfleeing suspect's car, and Felix reasonably believed that his life was in\nimminent danger.\nThat conclusion should end this case. Petitioner's contrary argument\nattacks a strawman.\nLet me be very clear.\nWe are defending the decision below and the moment of threat doctrine\nas it actually exists.\nThe core premise of that doctrine is that an officer doesn't lose his right\nto defend himself just because he made a mistake at an earlier point in\ntime.\nBut applying that rule does not require courts to ignore everything that\noccurred prior to the use of force.\nLike other circuits, the Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held that preceding\nevents are relevant to the extent they inform the officer's perception of\nthe danger that he faced.\nThe panel decision below repeatedly cited to and quoted from those\nvery precedents.\nThe panel did not and could not overrule them sub silentio.\nPetitioner asked the Court to create a new breed of constitutional tort\nunder which an officer facing the barrel of a gun loses his right to defend\nhimself if he previousl y used bad tactics or poor planning.\nThat's contrary to precedent and common sense.\nGraham asks only whether an officer's use of force was reasonable in the\nparticular circumstances he faced.\nIt requires courts to put themselves in the shoes of the officer who used\nforce, not to second-guess every decision the officer made in some of\nthe most stressful circumstances imaginable.\nAnd Plumhoff and Mendez rejected similar officer-created danger\ntheories as illogical, unwarranted, and inconsistent with precedent.\nThe Court should reject the theory again in this case and affirm the\njudgment of the court of appeals.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

McCloud:\nSo I guess, if I --if I could ask, if you do that, to do one additional thing,\nwhich is to make clear that the standard would have to be high, and\nmere negligence alone would not be enough to satisfy this officer-\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWell, now negligence involves mens rea, and that's subjective.\nAnd we've said in the Fourth Amendment it's an objective test.\nSo I --I -- that one, I -- up until then, you had me.\nBut now you -- now I'm afraid I'm getting off the train.\n### Charles L.

McCloud:\nBut that is the test that courts of appeals are applying in the country\nright now.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nDo you want a negligence test or do you not want a negligence test?\n### Charles L. McCloud:\nI do not want a negligence test.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nOkay.\nAll right. All right.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nYes.\nAnd it's an objective inquiry looking at the totality of the circumstances,\nright?\n### Charles L. McCloud:\nIt is an objective inquiry that looks at the totality of the circumstances\nto determine whether the officer genuinely believed there was a threat.\nYou do not look at the totality to determine, well, did the officer make a\nmistake and should he have gotten himself in that circumstance?\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nNo, whether he genuinely believes or whether there was an excessive\nuse of force.\nI thought -- I thought the latter was the question.\n### Charles L. McCloud:\nAnd this Court has consistently said that when an officer confronts a\ngenuine threat, it is not excessive to use force.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nThat's an objective inquiry, though, isn't it?\n### Charles L.
