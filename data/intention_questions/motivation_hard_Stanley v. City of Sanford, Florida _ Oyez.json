  "source_file": "Stanley v. City of Sanford, Florida _ Oyez.md",
  "background": "Karyn Stanley, a firefighter for the City of Sanford, Florida, retired due to Parkinson's disease in 2018 after serving for about 19 years. When she joined in 1999, the City's policy provided free health insurance until age 65 for employees retiring due to disability. However, in 2003, the City changed its plan, limiting the health insurance subsidy for disability retirees to 24 months post-retirement. Unaware of this change, Stanley filed suit in April 2020, shortly before her subsidy was set to expire, alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Rehabilitation Act, Florida Civil Rights Act, Equal Protection Clause, and Florida Statutes section 112.0801. The district court dismissed or granted summary judgment on all claims in favor of the City, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, relying on (and reaffirming) binding precedent within that circuit that “a Title I plaintiff must ‘hold[ ] or desire[ ]’ an employment position with the defendant at the time of the defendant's allegedly wrongful act.”",

Is it the disparate treatment between\nemployees who work 25 years and then retire and those who work a\nshorter period of time and retire on disability? Is that it? Or does it have\nsomething to do with the change in the -- in the scheme?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nOkay.\nSo let me -- there are two questions in there.\nLet me take both of them.\nSo I quite agree that the reasonable accommodation concept is not\nreally going to do much work in this scenario, and one way you know\nthat is, if you look at the construction provision, (b)(5), when it's\ndescribing the reasonable accommodation requirement, it actually adds\non this language.\nIt says \"qualified individual who is an applicant or employee.\" And so I\nthink that is how Congress cabined the provision just to applicants or\nemployees.\n### Justice Alito:\nYeah.\n### Justice Alito:\nI don't see how it could work.\nSo, if it's --which is it? Is it the change, or is it the current status?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nI think it's both.\nIt is an ongoing discrimination.\nLet me -- so, first of all, I'd just emphasize that neither of the courts\nbelow aggressed -- addressed the actual merits of the -- of the\ndiscrimination claim.\n### Justice Alito:\nNo, I --I understand that.\n### Justice Alito:\nI'm just -- I'm just trying to understand h ow this would work -- how\n### Deepak Gupta:\nRight.\n### Justice Alito:\nSo you have a situation where your client says -- let's just take the\nongoing status.\nYour client says that I'm being -- I -- I -- I'm a victim of discrimination\nbased on disability because I should be treated the same way as\nsomebody who worked 25 years.\nHow is a court supposed to determine whether this distinction between\nsomebody w ho works 25 years and somebody who works a shorter\nperiod and retires based on disability is unlawful? What is the test for\ndetermining that?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nYeah.\nI mean, I think it will --it will turn a lot on the claim.\nLet me try to describe what I think is going on here, which is that before\nthis policy was put into place, the City was treating three groups of\npeople as equally deserving of the subsidy, so people who had\ncompleted 25 years of service, people who had completed a combined\nyear -- 25 years of service when taking into account military service and\nother firefighting positions, and then people who retired with -- with a\ndisability.\nThat's the third category.\nAnd when faced with a budget shortfall, the City chose to only exclude\nthat third group, people with disabilities, from the subsidy despite the\nabsence of any evidence that it would ameliorate the shortfall.\nSo the City singled out people with disabilities solely because of their\ndisabilities.\nAnd, in fact, we know that the City has told a disabled retiree who did\nhave 25 years of service that he still could not have the subsidy because\nhe had, after 25 years, become disabled.\nSo what -- what we would, I think, want the opportunity to do on\nremand is to show that the City treated Lieutenant Stanley differently\nbecause of her disability.\nIf she weren't disabled, she would have made it to 25 years and gotten\nthe subsidy.\nAnd if the City didn't singled out --single out disabled people, she\nwould have gotten the subsidy.\nOf course, the City will have the opportunity on remand to show why\nwe're wrong and --in their view.\nAnd whether you think the underlying claim is doomed to fail or\ndestined to succeed, the -- the question presented is the same.\nAnd I do think these are difficult claims to succeed on.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, you've said -- you've said a lot.\nAnd I -- I -- I'm not asking -- I -- I -- I'm not talking about the validity\nof this particular claim.\nI just don't know how this is going to be approached.\nWhen you have --you have structured retirem ent benefits, distinctions\nare going to be made.\n### Deepak Gupta:\nRight.\n### Justice Alito:\nSo part of what you said seems to me -- seems to be that the City just\nhad irrational bias against people with a disability, okay? That would be\none -- one argument that might be made.\nAnother part of what you seem to have said is that they didn't really\nhave a -- an economy --a valid economy rationale.\nBy not extending the benefits to people who retire with disability, they\nreally weren't going to save any money.\nBut suppose there's no evidence of -- of bias and, presumably, they will\nsave some money and they say, look, we need to cut -- we needed to cut\nback, so we cut -- this is where we cut back and we have a reason for it.\nThe reason is that we want to reward people who work for us for 25\nyears.\nHow -- how is a court going to approach this kind of issue?\n### Justice Alito:\nBecause, if you take out the reasonable accommodation question, I just\ndon't know how this is going to be -- how it's going to be approached by\ncourts in the future.\n### Deepak Gupta:\nWell, Justice Alito, you mentioned, you know, a structured benefit plan\nand the ability to make sort of actuarial sorts of decisions.\nAnd Congress actually did focus on this precise problem when it drafted\nthe ADA, and it included a safe harbor provision.\nThat's Section 12201(c).\nAnd that immunizes plan sponsors, plan administrators, insurance\ncompanies, from these kinds of risk-based decisions.\nAnd, in fact, your opinion in the Ford case, your concurring opinion in\none of these decisions comprising the circuit split, mentioned that safe\nharbor.\nAnd I think that actually, to the extent that the amici on the other side\nare hypothesizing a flood of claims, the reason you haven't seen that in\nthe Second and Third Circuits is because that safe harbor provision takes\ncare of and immunizes defendants from -- from the large, you know,\nmajority of those kinds of claims.\n### Justice Alito:\nAll right.\nThank you. That's helpful.",

That paragraph of the complaint alleges\nthat she became disabled before she retired and also alleges that she\ncontinued to work until she retired. We think it's a plausible inference\nfrom that paragraph that she was a qualified individual with a disability\nat some point before she retired.\nIn the court of appeals, I would look at Romanette 8 and page 10 of her\nopening brief, pages 4 to 13 of her reply brief, and I would listen to the\nfirst five minutes of the oral argument below, in which Stanley herself\ndescribed the path I'm identifying here as \"the narrowest path to a\ndecision in her favor.\" And then, in this Court, I would -- I would cite the\nsame pages my friend cited in the petition, particularly pages 7, 11, 24,\nand 25. I would note that the City argued forfeiture in its brief in\nopposition.\nPresumably, this Court considered and rejected that forfeiture\ncontention as a basis for denying review and for good reason, because\nthis Court has said time and again that once a party has preserved an\nissue for this Court's consideration, that party can make any argument\nin support of that issue.\nAnd the issue here is whether Stanley satisfies the qualified individual\nrequirement.\nI want to emphasize why we think it's a good idea to decide this case\nnarrowly.\nFirst, we think it answers the question presented.\nSecond, we do think it would go a long way to resolving the circuit split.\nThat's identified at page 17A of the petition appendix.\nAnd the split implicates two decisions from the Sixth Circuit and the\nNinth Circuit, the McKnight decision and the Weyer decision, which\nboth held that former employees categorically cannot sue to enforce\nTitle I.\nAnd so, if this Court were to hold that at least someone in Stanley's\ncircumstances can sue even though she was a former employee when\nshe brought the suit, that would resolve that question that's divided the\ncircuits.",

And so long as you can\npoint to effects from that decision that do fall within the limitation\nperiod, then you can challenge that decision.\nWe -- we understand that to be the force of the Fair Pay Act in a context\nlike this.\n### Justice Alito:\nI don't want to take up too much time, but I am interested in the last\nquestions -- the last series of questions I asked Mr. Gupta.\nSo, in this case -- because I want to understand where this leads.\nIn -- in this case, Lieutenant Stanley is actually treated more favorably\nthan someone who retires after 20 years without a -- for a reason other\nthan disability.\nShe is treated less favorably than someone who retires after working for\n25 years.\nSo how is a court -- put aside -- there's no question of -- of bias, and\nthe -- the -- the employer puts that -- puts forward information that\nthis is based on cost saving and incentivizing working until 25.\nHow is a --what is the test for determining whether something like that\nis valid or not? The reasonable accommodation concept would work in\nthe employment context, but it doesn't work here.\nSo what's the answer?\n### Frederick Liu:\nYeah, I don't think this is a reasonable accommodation claim.\nI don't think Stanley has ever brought a reasonable accommodation\nclaim.\n### Justice Alito:\nOkay.\nIt's not reasonable accommodation.\n### Frederick Liu:\nRight.\n### Justice Alito:\nSo how do you determine whether this kind of a structure is -- is\ndiscriminatory?\n### Frederick Liu:\nSo we understand this to be a disparate treatment claim, and we\nunderstand that the right way to go about analyzing a disparate\ntreatment claim is to ask how a similarly situated person without\ndisabilities would be treated.\nAnd, as you know, the United States hasn't taken a position on this\nissue, but I -- I understand the parties to have staked out two different\nways of identifying the relevant similarly situated comparator.\nI think, if you ask Petitioner, what they would say is: What you do is you\nsubtract disability from the equation and you see what would have\nhappened then.\nAnd, in their view, if you subtract disability from the equation, their\nclient, Stanley, would have worked more than 25 years and, thus, been\neligible for benefits until she was 65.\nNow the City responds and says: Well, when you subtract disability from\nthe equation, that's all you subtract out, and you hold the terms of\nservice constant at 20 years.\nThey -- they would say that -- that Petitioner is changing two\nvariables, not only the -- the disability but also the terms of service.\nAnd so the City says: A similarly situated person with only 20 years of\nservice and no disability wouldn't have gotten benefits in this case, so\nStanley should lose. I think that's the form of the disparate treatment\nanalysis that should occur in the courts below.\nBut, as my friend pointed out, neither court analyzed the issue.\nIt doesn't affect this Court's consideration of the qualified individual",

Because, if\nshe's bringing a new claim, she has to be an otherwise qualified\nindividual.\nAnd it's not that easy to fit her situation at t hat time into the statutory\nlanguage.\nSo that's what concerns me about your argument.\nAnd could you answer --could you say why that is not fatal to your\nposition?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nSure.\nSo I think I have at least three responses.\nFirst -- my first response is to answer the question without resort to the\nFair Pay Act.\nImagine the Fair Pay -- Pay Act hadn't been enacted.\nLieutenant Stanley's claim was subject to the 300 -day requirement to\nfile the claim, and she filed within 214 days of the retirement. So, even if\nyou are just, you know, focusing on that period before she retired, in\nthat period, she was indisputably a qualified individual. She was subject\nto the policy, all the things I said before.\nAnd so that would, I think, get you out of this -- this problem that\nyou've described.\n### Justice Alito:\nOh, all right.\n### Deepak Gupta:\nknow, it may come up in other cases.\nAnd -- and I think what the statute says is that the -- the unlawful\npractice occurs at three points: the adoption, when the person is subject\nto the policy, and then where the effects are felt.\nAnd Congress was specifically focused on claims with respect to\ncompensation and amended the ADA to make clear that -- that this\napplied to the ADA.\nAnd so I think that is Congress telling us that at this very kind of\nsituation where somebody is subject to the policy, that the -- the\nunlawful practice occurs there.",

And the reason\nwhy is you don't have a claim of that kind unless there is either a\nprospective employment relationship or some employment\nrelationship that is the locus of that discrimination.\nThe same thing is true with respect to the ADA.\nSo I don't think our argument opens up some broad category of claims.\nYou still have to have that --the discrimination has to concern the\nterms and conditions or compensation of employment.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI have one other question.\nThe SG, I believe, takes the position that an employer discriminates\nagainst a retiree as to employment benefits that she earned while she\nwas a qualified individual.\n### Deepak Gupta:\nRight.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy don't you -- why haven't you adopted that?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nWell, we do endorse the -- the SG's theory.\nThat's what we meant to do in our reply.\nAnd -- and, if that wasn't clear, I -- I, you know, endorse the -- the SG's\ntheory, and I think it is an alternative textual pathway that gets you to\nbasically the same result.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nDoes that then take us to",

Conner:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Title I of the ADA prohibits\nemployers from discriminating on the basis of disability only against an\nindividual who can perform the job she holds or desires, present tense.\nThis Court has explained in Robinson that use of present tense verbs is\nan unambiguous temporal qualifier limiting a statute to reach to current\nemployees only. Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit correctly held that\nbecause Stanley cannot establish that the City committed any\ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could perform the essential\nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her Title I claim fails.\nIndeed, the City's 24-month rule on its face is applicable only to\nunqualified individuals who retire because they are unable to perform\ntheir jobs.\nHowever, Petitioner argues that the City subjected her to its polic y\nwhen she was a qualified individual during her employment.\nBut a qualified individual is not subject to a policy that only applies to\nunqualified individuals, just like a man is not subject to a policy that\napplies only to women, and a non-disabled employee is not subject to a\npolicy that only applies to disabled employees.\nThis proposition is so well-established that the Petitioner did not plead\nthat the City's policy discriminated against her as a qualified individual.\nInstead, the district court, at 26a, held that her Title I claim failed\nbecause her complaint alleged that the discrimination did not occur\nuntil plaintiff was no longer able to perform the essential functions of\nher job. This ruling should not be controversial.\nEveryone agrees, for example, that an employer does not violate Title I\nwhen it fires an employee who can no longer perform the essential\nfunctions of their job.\nThe outcome should be no different here simply because retirees or\npost-employment benefits are involved.\nThis Court should affirm.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Conner:\nOur argument is just slightly more nuanced.\nIt's the fact that this particular policy only applies to unqualified\nindividuals.\nSo what she's saying is discriminatory is the fact that she only received\nthe health insurance subsidy for 24 months after she retired and those\nwho had 25 years of service read the -- received the health insurance\nsubsidy to age 65.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo you're not saying that any retirement policy only applies to\nunqualified individuals.\nYou're saying this particular retirement policy only applies to\nunqualified individuals.\nAnd -- and -- I'm sorry for being dense, but tell me why.\n### Jessica C. Conner:\nSo this policy, what she's complaining about is that she only received 24\nmonths of the subsidy instead of receiving it to age 65 like 25 -year\nretirees receive.\nSo she's -- she's arguing that when we applied the 24 -month rule to\nher and stopped paying at 24 months, that was the discriminatory act.\nAnd that was when she was unqualified. And the policy -- the 24-\nmonth rule only applies to disability retirees.\nAnd that has a very specific meaning.\nA -- a disability retiree is not just somebody who has a disability and\nretires.\nA disability retire -- retirement is awarded to people who become\ncompletely unable to perform the essential functions of their job, and\nbecause of that reason, they take a disability retirement.\nThey retire early.\nSo the 24-month subsidy policy only applies to those totally disabled.\nAnd it would -- they would only become subject to it once they become\ntotally disabled and accept a disability retirement, which is what she\ndid.\nIf she had not taken a disability retirement, if she had continued to work\nfor 25 years, she would have received the full subsidy despite having a\ndisability.\nSo the policy was only applied to her, the 24-month rule, because she\nretired early with a disability that rendered her an unqualified\nindividual, and then the City applied the 24-month rule to her.",

The ADA allows her to challenge that policy even after she leaves the job. And that answers the question and resolves at least a chunk of the circuit split.

A firefighter who becomes disabled saving people from a burning building could be discriminated against the next month. A retired firefighter who develops a respiratory condition from years of smoke exposure could lose health coverage. And an employer could deny privileges that are extended to all other former employees, such as use of the company cafeteria or the attendance at a company retreat, based solely on disability -based animus.
