  "background": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe'll hear argument next in Case 23-1007, Cunningham versus Cornell\nUniversity.\nMr. Wang.\n### Xiao Wang:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted\nERISA, it identified a number of prohibited transactions and codified\nthat understanding in 29 U.S.C. Section 1106.\nIn Congress's view, these transactions posed a special risk of being\npotentially harmful to the plan, generally because they involved a party\nin interest, which includes a fiduciary's relative or an officer or an owner\nof the plan or a person providing services to the plan.\nPetitioners here have identified a transaction that falls within the text\nof Section 1106, and the Second Circuit's decision to dismiss that claim\nprior to discovery was incorrect for three reasons. First, text and\nstructure.\nCongress frequently writes laws where it puts liability in one part of the\nstatute and exceptions to liability in another, and when it does so, this\nCourt has time and again held that plaintiffs plead and prove liability\nand defendants plead and prove exceptions to liability.\nSecond, precedent.\nIn Keystone Consolidated and Harris Trust, this Court made clear that\nthe prohibited transaction provisions provide for categorical rules.\nBut what the Second Circuit's approach does is it conver ts those\ncategorical rules into qualified ones.\nAnd that brings me to the final reason for reversal, which is that they're\nnot just qualified prohibitions, but they're qualified based on\nexemptions that involve information that plaintiffs cannot know and do\nnot know prior to discovery, information like who the counterparties are\nin a cross-trade or how large a block trade is or what asset classes are in\na block trade, which is exactly why, when Congress wrote these\nprovisions, it intended for petitioners to plead and prove under Section\n1106 and for defendants to plead and prove under Section 1108.\nFor these reasons, Your Honor, we ask this Court to reverse the\njudgment of the Second Circuit.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Sotomayor\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI do.\nThis isn't that easy a case in my mind.\nYou're right about the general rules we've set, but this statute is slightly\ndifferent because many of the cases that we've seen before, the\nprohibitions were on one page and the exemptions were in a different\nsection, but the prohibition didn't reference the exceptions the way this\nstatute does.\nIt says, except for the exemptions in 1108, you can't do the following.\nOn the other hand, there's 21 exemptions within 1108, but I also\nunderstand there's dozens, if not a hundred more, that have been\npassed by the Department of Labor.\nAnd if we accept the other side's position that you have to prove the\ncase and say there's no exemption, I don't know how you'd know that.\nYou're right, how will you know which exemptions are pertinent or not,\ncorrect?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCorrect.\nCorrect.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd so that's really the problem in this case, which is either -- whatever\nwe decide, someone's going to be potentially unfairly treated because\nyou have --no plaintiff has a way of knowing what all the exemptions\nare and what potential exemptions the other side could pick.\n### Xiao Wang:\nCertainly, Justice Sotomayor.\n### Xiao Wang:\nSorry.\n### Xiao Wang:\nApologies.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nOkay.\nThat's a given.\nBut, here, it's pretty clear that you alleged and you thought you had\nsome sort of burden because I read your very extensive complaint, and\n### Xiao Wang:\nCorrect.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nYou allege it's unreasonable.\nYou show a lot of other fees. I'm not quite sure still, and I will ask the\ngovernment this, under normal pleading standards, I would have\nthought this was enough.\nI think that the Second Circuit was thinking that it has to be pled with\nTwombly and Iqbal as a fraud and that you needed more particularized\ninformation relating to the nature of the services in total, some\ninformation that you say you couldn't have known.\n### Xiao Wang:\nYes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nYou just knew how much was being paid and you compared it to what\nother people were paying.\n### Xiao Wang:\nComparable plans, yes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nExactly.\nSo, if I have a problem with that part of it, that the Second Circuit may\nhave asked for more than you needed to plead, what do I do?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nEven if I accepted their proposition that you need to allege for whatever\nreason a pleading standard, injury standard, that you have to allege\nsomething more than that they have a transaction, do I get to address\nthat or I don't, or what am I doing here?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCertainly, Justice Sotomayor.\nI think that what you're doing here is -- is, first, I think you would\nreverse. We -- we would ask this Court to reverse the judgment of the\nSecond Circuit.\nAnd it would reverse by saying, look, you --if these are enough under\nIqbal and Twombly and it involves unreasonableness, then whatever\nrule you apply, we would still say that there was a legal error here. But, if\nI can get back to what I think may be the first part of your question,\nwhich is perhaps the relative weakness of our --of our decision about\nthe \"except as otherwise provided\" language at the top, well, first, I\nthink that precedent answers this point, and precedent answers this\npoint in a couple different ways.\nOne is Respondents have provided no cases where that actually changes\nthe calculus. It turns except -- the words \"except as otherwise\nprovided\" magically turns the word -- the exempt -- exemptions into\nelements.\nThere's no case on that point.\nIn fact, the cases like Atlantic Richfield and Schlemmer make fairly clear\nthat all that's doing is saying w hat happens when things clash.\nIt doesn't expand or contract the liability provisions at all.\nAnd I think, sort of maybe as a concluding point on this point, that is\nreinforced by the structure and the complexity and the nuance that's\nprovided in 1108 that involves an information asymmetry that -- that,\nagain, cannot be addressed prior to discovery.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI'm going to ask the other two about the Second Circuit factual ruling,\nwhich was that with respect to this provision, you have the burden of\nshowing unreasonableness, but it reserved consideration of whether\nthere were other exemptions that you didn't bear the burden about\nproving.\nI don't know how it got there at all.\n### Xiao Wang:\nRight.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd I'll ask the government and your adversary how we do that. But\nCook did say that -- established a narrow ruling for criminal pleadings.\nI don't think there's any case that ever has applied it to civil\nexemptions, correct?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCorrect.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo it's hard to rely on Cook, but the essence of its thinking was, if a\nprohibition looks like -- if a prohibition looks like it's -- you can't really\ntell it's illegal or not because the exemption here says you can have\nthese relationships, you can just have them with reasonable fees, then\nyou need for the -- for the government -- for the government to prove\nthey were unreasonable.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy wouldn't that apply here, that concept?\n### Xiao Wang:\nWhy wouldn't Cook's apply here?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nObservation.\n### Xiao Wang:\nYeah.\nI -- I --I think it wouldn't apply not simply just because of the\ncriminal/civil distinction that we talked a bout but also for the\ninformation asymmetries that you mention.\nAnd it doesn't sort of -- really, I think the Respondents are asking this\nCourt to sort of carve out the statute in a few different ways, to --to try\nto gerrymander it by saying: Look, we'll put the (b)(2) exemption, we'll\ntreat that as an element and we'll try to carve out service providers, and\nthen we'll stitch together 1106 and 1108.\nBut that's not how the statute is written.\nAnd, certainly, that might lead to some results.\nWe don't see that happening in the Eighth or Ninth Circuits, but, if it\ndoes, I think that's in Congress's province to address.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThank you.",

Saharsky:\nYeah.\n### Justice Jackson:\nWhat -- what's your response to that?\n### Nicole A.

And then what do we do\nabout the information asymmetry, the fact that plaintiff could not\npossibly know many of them?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nWell, the plaintiff only has to plead the one that's relevant on the facts\nof the case.\nAnd I think it helps to think that, you know, a case comes to a court to\nchallenge -- a plaintiff is challenging a particular transaction.\nEither it's a service provider contract or it's a certain type of buying of\nemployer stock or something else.\nAnd the different exemptions apply to different factual circumstances.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut are --but do they have to be consistent with respect to the burden\nthat you say falls on the plaintiff? Are they all elements, all 21\nexceptions?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nWith respect to 1106(a) claims, which include the exemption and\notherwise would be only innocuous conduct, then, yes, the relevant\nexception in Section 1108 would be an affirmative defense, but not all of\nthem would be relevant in every case on the facts.\nAnd I think you can think about this in terms of what a plaintiff has to\nplead to go forward with a complaint.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI'm sorry.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nI said that you would -- that a plaintiff would have to plead facts\nregarding the one that was -- regarding the transaction, the type of\ntransaction, that's applicable in their case.\nSo, for example, there are some that involve block trades or cross-\ntrades or buying employer stock.\nAnd no one was doing any of those things here, so there's no\nrequirement to plead those kind of facts.\nThe plaintiff's burden is not to plead legal conclusions but to plead facts\nthat show an entitlement to relief.\n### Justice Jackson:\nNo, I understand the plaintiff's burden generally.\n### Nicole A.

I mean, do we have to worry\nthat if we're suddenly saying that the exemptions in this structure are\nelements that we're going to implicate things like the Federal\nArbitration Act, which has a similar dynamic?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nI don't think it's a problem because this Court considers each case and\neach statute as it comes.\nThat's what it has been doing since the decision in Cook, where it said,\nlook, if we look at something and it's called an exemption and it's in a\nseparate provision, we probably would think it's an affirmative defense,\nbut there are some circumstances in which we don't, say, if there's a\ncross-reference to the provision or it's direct -- there's some other way\nthat it's directly incorporated or, for example, if the conduct that is in\nthe initial prohibition covers so much beneficial innocuous conduct that\nyou think we can't define the wrongful thing that Congress was trying\nto get at without -- without using the exemption.\nAnd that's the inquiry that this Court has done, and that's the inquiry I",

Saharsky:\nRight.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAnd -- and the context would seem to be key on that.\nAnd some of the concerns that we've been discussing or I've been\nraising and the amicus briefs raise, others have raised, would suggest\nthat this -- the context here suggests it doesn't make much sense to\nread this 1106(a) that way.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nRight.\nSo I'd point the Court to four factors.\nOne, the incredible breadth of Section 1106(a), which reaches so much\ninnocent conduct, nothing wrongful, not limited to wrongful conduct by\nitself.\nThen you have the cross -reference, which says: Okay, we don't have to\nread it by itself.\nWe're being told that we should read it with Section 1108, which is what\nlimits it to the wrongful conduct.\nAnd then you don't see that cross -reference in Section 1106(b), which is\nthe one that defines only wrongful conduct, only transactions that\ninvolve self-interest in conduct.\nSo you think I've got to give some meaning to that language that's in\n1106(a), the cross-reference, but not in 1106(b). Petitioners' view does\nnot give any meaning to that language.\nIt is superfluous.\nAnd then the fourth thing I think about is that there are other parts of\nERISA where Congress either encouraged or expressly required the use\nof service providers.\nAnd I think to myself: Well, Congress said that plans have to do this and\nevery plan does it, so it would make no sense at all to say that Congress\njust defined the cause of action as using a service provider.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nIf I put that all together, I'd have to come out that this would be part of\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nSo, on the context, you're pulling in the other statutory provisions too.\nI think that fourth point's pretty important.\nAnd then another point, I just want to be crystal -clear on this because\nthe other side says: Well, what about the insider transactions? And\nthose are 1106(b), correct?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nSo 1106(b) are when the fiduciary -- the fiduciary has conflicts of\ninterest, self -dealing.\nThose are all on their face bad transactions.\nI understand the argument that the other side of the government is to\nbe making is: Well, maybe 1106(a) is also like that because parties in\ninterest include insiders.\nBut they include a lot of people who aren't -- aren't involved in\nconflicted transactions.\nThey include service providers.\nI mean, it is an -- the immense breadth of the party-in-interest\ndefinition is -- is hard to describe.\nBut I think the point of that is is that you need a way to limit the 1106(a)\nprovision, and the cross-reference tells you to do it using the\nexemptions.",

Another one is\nstanding, expedited discovery, coupled with a motion for summary\njudgment, fee shifting, sanctions.\nWhy are -- are they not sufficient?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nRight.\nBecause the rule is that a plaintiff has to come to court and plead the\nelements and doesn't have to plead affirmative defenses.\nNow, if the Court -- and that's -- that's how Iqbal and Twombly are\nunderstood. That's what it means to bring a claim to court and plead\nfacts to show an entitlement to relief.\nIt's entitlement to relief on -- on the elements.\n### Justice Alito:\nOkay.\nWhat about the Rule 7 workround?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nSo we think that that is kind of convoluted and discretionary and that's\nthe problem with it . First of all, there would not be an opportunity to\nRule 11 -- Rule 7 just applies to an answer.\nSo the Court has discretion about whether the Court can -- whether it\ncan -- it asks for a reply brief or not.\nSo I guess what the government is thinking is the plaintiff pleads the\nmere fact of a service provider transaction.\nThe defendant says no, this --it is a --for reasonable fees and necessary\nservices.\nAnd then, at that point, the court should exercise its discretion to\nrequire the plaintiff to plead additional facts to show that the fees are\nunreasonable or the service is unnecessary.\nThe problem with that is that it's discretionary.\nA plaintiff could go to a district court that's favorable, not -- the district\ncourt would say: I don't want to do that.\nAnd then it's off to discovery and off to summary judgment.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, could we say that in the --in the particular circumstances here, it\nwould be an abuse of discretion for the district court not to follow that\nprocedure?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nThe Court absolutely could say that.\nI guess my suggestion would be is that the Court should be very clear if\nthat's what the Court wants, because that's not the way that things\nhappen now with respect to Rule 7. And so the Court would -- would\nhopefully say that in those circumstances, in --in the case of a service\nprovider transaction, that if the defendant alleges that the fees were\nreasonable, the services were necessary, something in Section 1108,\nthat then the district court absolutely should require the plaintiff to\nrespond and plead facts to show, plausibly show, that the fees were\nunreaso nable. I mean, our bottom line, which I understand to be the\nsame as the government's bottom line, although I'm not entirely sure,\nis that the plaintiff should not be able to just come to court and say\nthere was a service provider transaction, that's bad, we're off to the\nraces with a lawsuit.\n### Justice Alito:\nOkay.\n### Justice Alito:\nsummary judgment motion?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nSo I will address each of those, but let me just say none of these\nsupposed solutions or guardrails are working now in the district courts,\nand that would be before the Court announced a rule that you could\nperhaps just go in with a service provi der transaction.\nAnd just one point on that.\nYou know, there have been two dozens lawsuits that have been filed\nagainst university plans.\nIn none of them has a court found that the plaintiff succeeded on the\nmerits.\nThis has been, like, millions of dollars that these universities have spent\non discovery and individuals who have been named personally and had\nto live under a clued for years and years.\nSo this idea that there are these great guardrails that are going to solve\nthat problem, that's not happening now, and that's before Petitioners'\nposition gets accepted.\nBut, to -- to specifically answer your question, I don't know that\nstanding is a solution because standing, establishing an -- an -- an\ninjury for standing is different from establishing an entitlement to relief\nunder a cause of action.\nI don't know what injury a plaintiff might claim.\nI mean, I think Petitioners' theory is that the mere fact of paying money\nto a service provider is an injury because Congress decided that that was\nbad or at least presumptively bad.\nSo now there's been a suggestion that the injury would be unreasonable\nfees, but I -- that --that, to me, gets us back to, well, aren't the\nunreasonable fees part of the elements, so the cause of action.\nSo I -- there's also the possibility of jurisdictional discovery and\nstanding, which, you know, makes it seem to me like not a very great\nsolution.\nAnd I guess the last thing I would say on that is, you know, if -- if -- if\nthere is a standing problem or a -- some other constitutional problem\nwith the statutory interpretation the Petitioners are suggesting, that\nwould be a good reason not to do that thing and to take the other\nreading of the statute, which is much more reasonable.\nI mean, nearly every court that's looked at this and, you know,\napparently, the Solicitor General say Petitioners' position just can't be\nright, that just cannot be right.\nAnd there has to be a way to make sure that the plaintiffs have some\nburden to plead something more.\nAnd there's a really obvious way to do that, which is to say, well, in this\ncircumstance, we understand that Section 1108 helps to define the\ncause of action, to say that this is actually something that the plaintiffs\nhave to plead.\nAnd I -- just to get back to a -- a point",

And what\nare those complaints exactly, and what takes you out of that category?\n### Yaira Dubin:\nSure.\nAnd let me be very clear about this.\nI think Box 1 is a complaint that just allege s a service provider\ntransaction for routine services.\nThat's Box 1.\nBox 2 is a complaint that includes allegations like the ones we see here:\nthat the fees are excessi ve, four to five times the industry benchmark,\nthat there's a reason to think the plan is paying excessive fees, that\nthey're using multiple recordkeepers when they could have used one,\nthat he didn't engage in a competitive process for these recordkeeping\nservices.\n### Justice Kagan:\nTo me, that doesn't sound like a bare-bones complaint.\nAre you suggesting otherwise?\n### Yaira Dubin:\nThat's exactly our position here, which is that Box 2 is where the\ncomplaint should be.\nAnd, in fact, that is where the complaints that we're seeing on the\nground are, that suits being brought under this allege that there are\nexcessive fees and that there are reasons to think the fees are excessive.\nThat's actually what the practice is playing out on the ground, and I\nthink the practice is playing out on the ground that way because of the\nconstraints we've been talking about today.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo those are not ones that in any circumstance would raise the necessity\nof talking about affirmative defenses?\n### Yaira Dubin:\nThat is our view. Obviously, the Second Circuit disagreed with us. That\nwas exactly the complaint they had.\n### Justice Kagan:\nYes, yes, yes, but -- right.\n### Yaira Dubin:\nYes.\nThat's exactly our view.\n### Justice Kagan:\nOkay.\nYou were going to go on and tell me about Box 3? Maybe not.\n### Yaira Dubin:\nI --I'm happy to. Box 3 relates to the quality of the services.\nThat's what the Second Circuit held. The Second Circuit held that it\ndoesn't matter all this information that you've included about how\nexcessive these fees are.\nThis might be the Cadillac of recordkeeping plans.\nAnd if it's the Cadillac of recordkeeping plans, then those fees were\njustified.\nAnd the problem is that Petitioners have no way of knowing if it's the\nCadillac of recordkeeping plans.\n### Justice Kagan:\nBut I take it that as you survey the litigation here, you're -- you're\nsaying that most of these complaints or all of these complaints are Box 2\ncomplaints, not the kind of bare-bones complaints that would suggest\nsome special need to do Iqbal maneuvers?\n### Yaira Dubin:\nThat's right.\nThose are the ones we're seeing.\nAnd we haven't seen Respondents identify any bare-bones complaints,\nincluding in the Eighth Circuit, which has been applying this rule that\nPetitioners are advocating for for 15 years, and we think that's because\nof the constraints that are already operating.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.",
