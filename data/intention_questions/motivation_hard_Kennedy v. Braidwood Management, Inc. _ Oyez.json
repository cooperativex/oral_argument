  "background": "In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which requires private insurers to cover certain preventive-care services without cost sharing. Rather than defining these services directly, the ACA empowers three agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services to determine required services: the United States Preventive Services Task Force (Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The Task Force consists of sixteen volunteer experts serving four-year terms, ACIP has fifteen members selected by the HHS Secretary, and HRSA operates through offices and bureaus reporting to the HHS Secretary. Over the years, these agencies issued various preventive care recommendations, including ACIP’s 2007 recommendation for HPV vaccines, HRSA’s 2011 guidelines for contraceptive coverage, and the Task Force’s 2019 recommendation for HIV prevention drugs (PrEP). Four individuals and two Christian-based businesses in Texas challenged these requirements, arguing that mandatory coverage of these services violated their religious beliefs by making them “complicit in facilitating homosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage between one man and one woman.” The plaintiffs filed suit in 2020 against the federal government and various department secretaries, primarily arguing that the structure of these agencies violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. The district court ruled in their favor regarding the Task Force but rejected their challenges to ACIP and HRSA, and both parties appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the Task Force’s structure violated the Appointments Clause and upheld the injunction against enforcing its recommendations, but reversed the district court’s universal remedies and remanded for further consideration of whether HHS properly ratified ACIP and HRSA’s recommendations.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Thomas\n### Justice Thomas:\nBefore we get to the constitutional problems, what's the statutory\nauthority to appoint the Task Force?\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo there are two sources of authority, Your Honor.\nThe first is that under the Reorganization Act, the Secretary has the\npower to exercise all functions and duties of the director, and the\ndirector, under 299, has the authority to convene the Task Force.\n### Justice Thomas:\nIsn't that an odd delegation? Normally, it would be the superior or the\nprincipal officer who would have the authority who would delegate it to\nsubordinates.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nWell, it's not just a delegation, Your Honor.\nThe Reorganization Act was in place when 299 was enacted.\nAnd so, when Congress passed 299 and said that the director could\nconvene the Task Force, that meant that the Secretary could convene\nthe Task Force.\n### Justice Thomas:\nSo what --so the word --you're using the word \"convene?\"\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nYes, Your Honor.\n### Justice Thomas:\nWell, I think that normally connotes just calling a meeting or\nsomething.\nThe court was convened this morning.\nThe Chief didn't appoint any of us.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo I agree, Your Honor, that \"convene\" doesn't necessarily connote\nappointment, but there's no other language in the statute that specifies\nwho will appoint these members, and in that -- in light of that,\n\"convene\" is most naturally read to mean convene and select the\npeople who will serve on -- on the board.\nAnd that's clearly true before nine -- before the ACA.\nBefore the ACA was enacted, it's clear that the Secretary and the\ndirector had the power to convene these -- to appoint these individuals.\n### Justice Thomas:\nBut appointment would not be an issue if they had no authority to\nrequire anything of --of others.\nIt's just advisory.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nWell, not as a constitutional matter but as a statutory matter, and I took\nyour question to be, where is the statutory authority to do this? Before\nthe ACA, it had to be the case that the Secretary or the director had the\nauthority.\nIt would not be constitutional for the president to select and the Senate\nto confirm these individuals before the ACA because, before the ACA,\neveryone agrees they weren't officers.\nAnd the Senate has no constitutional power to have any role in the\nselection of a non-officer. So the only way to construe the statute\nbefore the ACA is that the Secretary and the director had the ability, and\nnothing about the ACA changed that.\n### Justice Thomas:\nCan you give me an example of another body that's selected this way\njust with using the operative term \"convene\" and that had been and\nthat the authority comes from --through a subordinate to the\nprincipal?\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo not off the top of my head, Your Honor, but, again, the -- as a\n### Justice Thomas:\nYeah.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nanywhere in the code that says who will pick these people.\nSo the most natural way of reading a provision that says he shall\nconvene the Task Force is to also select the people who will serve on the\nTask Force.",

Mooppan:\nI don't think so, Your Honor.\nLet me give you the most straightforward of them.\nUnder the statute itself, no recommendation takes effect until the\nSecretary sets the minimum interval period.\n### Justice Alito:\nRight, right.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nAnd the minimum interval period is at least one year.\n### Justice Alito:\nYeah.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo one year is more than adequate time for the Secretary, if he doesn't\nagree with the recommendation, to direct the board to rescind it, the\nforce to rescind it and, if the Task Force doesn't rescind it, to replace\nthem with people who will.\nThat doesn't seem very jerry-built to me. In addition to that, the\nSecretary also has the power to create a pre-approval requirement.\nUnder 300gg-92, he has rulemaking power to implement the statute,\nand he can say: Before you issue any recommendations, submit it to me\nfor my approval, and if and only if I approve it can you issue it in the first\nplace.\n### Justice Alito:\nAnd if -- if -- if Congress really wanted these Task Force members to do\nthe bidding of the Secretary, isn't that an incredibly odd way to go about\nconferring that authority?\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nNo, because, critically, we are not saying that Congress wanted the Task\nForce to do the Secretary's bidding.\nWe agree that the Task -- the Secretary cannot tell the Task Force to\nmake a given recommendation.\nIf the Task Force doesn't want to make a recommendation, it doesn't\nhave to make a recommendation.\nOur point is simply that if the Task Force does make a recommendation,\nthe Secretary can block it.\nIt's --to use an analogy, it's like bicameralism.\nThe Senate can't force the House to pass a bill.\nBut, if the Senate doesn't also agree with the bill, it doesn't become a\nlaw.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, under the argument that you just made, why can't the Secretary\ndemand that a particular recommendation be made using exactly the\nsame author ity that you just outlined? What am I missing? The\npresident says: I want you to make this recommendation, and if you\ndon't make this recommendation, I'm going to remove you and replace\nyou with somebody who will make the recommendation.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo he can remove them, but we don't think he has the ability to force\nthe phrase \"independence\" and, more importantly, the phrase \"the\nrecommendations made shall be independent\" in 299b-4(a)(6), we do\nthink that that language does prevent that.\nAnd that makes perfect sense.\nIf you take a step back and think about the statutory scheme, Congress\nwas, as it often does, balancing competing objectives.\nOn the one hand, it wanted the benefits of an expert body. It wanted\nrecommendations that reflected their best scientific judgment.\nBut, on the other hand, it recognized that you need to have political\naccountability.\nAnd so the Secretary can block it, but -- and that solves the problem.\nIt means that no final decision could be made that binds the public\nunless the Secretary approves it.",

Mitchell:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals\ncorrectly held that Task Force members are principal officers who must\nbe appointed by the president and the Senate, as required by Article II.\nThey cannot be inferior officers because their task -- because their\npreventive care coverage mandates are neither directed nor supervised\nby the Secretary of Health and Human Services or by anyone else who\nhas been appointed as a principal officer.\nThe governing statutes make this clear.\nSection 300gg-13(a)(1) gives the Task Force alone the prerogative to\nimpose preventive care coverage mandates on insurers regardless of\nwhether the Secretary approves or disapproves a Task Force\nrecommendation.\nAnd Section 299b -4(a)(1) and (a)(6) require the Task Force members\nand their recommendations be kept independent and, to the extent\npracticable, protected from any type of political pressure.\nThese statutes cannot co-exist with a regime in which the Secretary can\noverrule the Task Force coverage recommendations or deny them\nbinding effect.\nThe Court also has no authority to sever Section 299b-4(a)(6), as\nproposed by the government.\nThe remedy prescribed by this Court must take the form of a final\njudgment to be entered by the district court on remand.\nAnd a federal district court has no authority and no ability to formally\nrevoke or cancel a statutory provision when entering judgment for a\nparty.\nMore importantly, a remedy from this Court must, to the maximum\npossible extent, respect the will of Congress as reflected in its enacted\nlaws.\nCongress has chosen to create an independent Task Force and shield it\nfrom political pressure, and the plaintiffs' proposed remedy honors that\ncongressional decision.\nThe government's proposed remedy would rewrite the statute into\nsomething unrecognizable by the Congress that enacted the ACA.\nAnd it is not even clear that Congress would have approved a regime in\nwhich politicians, rather than an independent Task Force, decide the\npreventive care that insurers must cover.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Mitchell:\nYes.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBecause we don't just have potential at -will removal power here. We\nhave something in this statute that seems to me to be fairly unusual,\nwhich is the requirement that the Secretary establish this minimal\ninterval after the recommendation is made before they come -- it\ncomes into effect.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nRight.\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo can you speak to why that doesn't have some indicia of secretarial\ncontrol that we can look to when we try to understand the relationship\nbetween the Secretary and these members and their\nrecommendations?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nI think it has the opposite implication,\n### Justice Jackson:\n, because 300gg-\n13 specifically addresses the Secretary's role vis-- vis the Task Force,\nand as Justice Kavanaugh suggested earlier, it only allows the Secretary\nto determine when these preventive care provisions are to take effect.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI mean, if you're right that these are principal officers who are making\nbinding recommendations, I guess I'm struggling to understand what\nthe point of deferring them or allowing the Secretary to intervene and\ndefer them for at least a year, what is -- what is the point of that?\n### Jonathan F.

Mitchell:\nRight.\n### Justice Jackson:\nMr. Mooppan says, during that interval, the Secretary can not only delay\nthe recommendations but can also, in his view, take some steps as to\nthe constitution of the Task Force, perhaps even in communication with\nthem regarding those steps having been done because they made\ncertain recommendations with --with respect to which the Secretary\ndisagrees.\nSo I guess I'm just trying -- I mean, it doesn't necessarily suggest that\nreally this is only a time -related thing.\nThe Secretary's getting involved.\nHe's making decisions.\nWhy doesn't that give us some basis for interpreting this to be a statute\nin which there is secretarial control?\n### Jonathan F.

Mitchell:\nAny kind of pressure,\n### Justice Alito:\n, is incompatible in our view with the\nstatutory guarantees of independence.\nI don't see how that distinction can be reconciled with the text of a\nstatute that not only guarantees the independence of the Task Force\nmembers and their recommendations but also says that the Task Force\nand their recommendations has to be immunized from political\npressure to the extent practicable.\nI just don't see how that distinction could be squared with anything in\nthe text of the statute.\nI think what Mr. Mooppan is trying to do is salvage some role for 299b-\n4(a)(6) because it's not plausible, I think, even on the government's\nview to allow the earlier enacted statutes, such as Section 202 and the\nReorganization Plan, to completely swallow up these later-enacted\nguarantees of independence. So they're trying to draw some line. But\nthere's nothing in the text of the statute that can provide an anchor for\nthe distinction he --that he's trying to draw.\nSuppose it were ultimately -- suppose it is ultimately decided that the\nstatute implicitly confers the appointment power on the Secretary and\nthat -- and then how much more of the statute would have to be\njettisoned in order to make it constitutional?\n### Justice Alito:\nLike the setup constitutional?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nYeah.\nNone of the statute needs to be jettisoned in order to make it\nconstitutional even under our reading of the statute.\nIf the Court decides that Congress has vested the Secretary with\nappointment power over the Task Force, the appointments are still\nunconstitutional in our view because they're principal officers.\nThey have to be appointed by the president and the Senate no matter\nwhat.\nBut, if the Court even rejects that view, there's still the problem that the\nTask Force was appointed by the AHRQ director for 13 years between\n2010 in March and June of 2023, and there has to be some remedy\nissued for those admitted constitutional violations.\n### Justice Alito:\nSo that would be -- that would be for the -- what was done before\nSecretary Becerra.\nWhat about going forward? What would need to be done?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nGoing forward, it will depend on whether the Court thinks these are\nprincipal officers.\nIf the Court thinks they're principal officers, then they have to be\nappointed by the president and the Senate as well.\n### Justice Alito:\nSuppose we thought that they were inferior officers.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nIf the Court thinks they're inferior officers, there should be a remand, in\nour view, to the Fifth Circuit to rule on the question whether Congress\nhas vested the Secretary of Health and Human Services with\nappointment power.\nI don't think it's appropriate for the Court to decide that issue based on\nhow cursory the briefing is.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, suppose that -- suppose we do that, the Fifth Circuit goes back\nand says that, or we tackle the question and we say that the statute\nvests -- vests the appointment power in the Secretary.\nThen what?\n### Justice Alito:\nAnd what -- that's what I'm asking.\nWhat would the remedy be?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nThe remedy would have to be an injunction that restrains the Secretary\nfrom enforcing any of the Task Force coverage recommendations that\nissued between March of 2010 and June of 2023.\nEven the government concedes the Task Force was unconstitutionally\nappointed during that time.\nSo I don't see how the government can deny that we're entitled to at\nleast that much.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nIf the Court -- the remedy going forward if the Court concludes that\nthey're inferior officers and that the Secretary's been vested with\nappointment power, there should be no remedy going forward.\nWe only can get a remedy for those past --that 13-year window.\n### Justice Alito:\nOkay.\nThank you.",

Mooppan:\nWell, at a bare minimum, the circumstances where the statute would be\nunconstitutional if the Secretary couldn't engage in that level of\nsupervision.\nSo I -- again, I think that that language just underscores the\nconstitutional avoidance point that the limited forms of review on the\nback end that we've emphasized have got to be permissible under that\nstatute both because it has that language in it and because the canon of\nconstitutional avoidance says you should read it that way.\nAnd, again, going back to the adjudicators, it's not just the Benefits\nReview Board.\nMore generally, under the APA, the statutory scheme for adjudication\nhas exactly this feature to it.\nYou have adjudicators who are tasked with exercising independent\njudgment, but their actions on the back end can be reviewed.",

Mitchell:\nWell, if you look at page 504 of the Court's opinion in Free Enterprise\nFund, it lists all the ways in which the SEC had these oversight\nauthorities.\nAnd this is not -- with all respect, Your Honor, this is not a situation of\nnon -action.\nWhen the Task Force decides to issue a C, D, or I rating rather than an A or\nB rating, that is action. It's not inaction.\nIf the Task Force decides to withdraw an A or B rating that it previously\nconferred, that is also action rather than inaction.\nSo the government's brief tries to rely on the act/omission distinction.\nIt just doesn't hold up here.\nThere will be situations in which the Task Force can take affirmative\nactions that cause a certain type of preventive care not to receive the A\nor B rating.\nAnd the government concedes that's unreviewable, so that means\nthey're still principal officers.\nBut there's a second problem as well. Even if this Court were to think\nthat Task Force members become inferior officers under the\ngovernment's interpretation of the statute, they are still\nunconstitutionally appointed because Congress has not vested the\nSecretary of Health and Human Service with the authority to appoint\nthe Task Force.\nAnd the court of appeals did not reach this question, as\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nnoted during the questioning of Mr. Mooppan.\nBut the Court would have to conclude that there was vesting of this\nauthority in the Secretary before it can say that they're constitutionally\nappointed now.",
