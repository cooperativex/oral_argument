  "background": "Anastasia Wullschleger filed a class-action complaint in Missouri state court against Royal Canin and Nestle Purina, alleging that their requirement for a prescription for specialized dog food was misleading and led to higher prices. The defendants removed the case to federal court, which remanded it back to state court, and then they appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which determined that the antitrust and unjust-enrichment claims raised substantial federal issues and belonged in federal court. Upon returning to the district court, Wullschleger amended her complaint to remove references to federal law, dropped the antitrust and unjust-enrichment claims, and added a civil-conspiracy claim. Despite these changes, the district court exercised federal-question jurisdiction and ultimately granted the manufacturersâ€™ motion to dismiss, leading to a second appeal. Reviewing the case de novo, the Eighth Circuit concluded that amending a complaint to eliminate the only federal questions destroys subject-matter jurisdiction and thus returned the case to state court.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Kagan\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo do you think, Ms. Wellington, that --let's say this wasn't a removal\ncase.\nLet's say this was an original case and it was brought in federal court,\nand then the plaintiff took out the federal claim, leaving only state\nclaims.\nIs there supplemental jurisdiction there?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo this Court has treated these two situations differently, and Justice\nScalia explained why in Rockwell.\nSo there was a concern in Rockwell that when a plaintiff goes into\nfederal court, pleads a federal question, and then immediately or\nsubsequently drops it, that they're trying to plead their way into federal\ncourt.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo forgetting what the reason for that is, you do agree with that rule\nthat once I file a suit in federal court as an original matter, then take out\nthe federal claims, leaving only state law claims, there's nothing at that\npoint for the federal court to do? It's not a doctrine of discretion\nanymore. The federal court has to dismiss.\nIs that correct?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThat is how we have asked this Court to read Rockwell.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nYes.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThat is our view.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo, if that's the case, I don't think that your arguments from 1367 can be\nright because your arguments from 1367 would suggest the opposite\nresult in the case that I gave.\nIn other words, it's very hard to read 1367 as imposing some kind of\ndistinction between original cases and removed cases.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo I agree, Your Honor, that there is no distinction in the text of 1367\nitself.\nThis Court could revisit its decision in Rockwell or limit it to the FCA\ncontext.\nWe haven't asked the Court to do that because we think that we win on\n### Justice Kagan:\nI guess what it suggests to me, though, is, if you were willing to say,\nlook, the Rockwell understanding of original cases is settled, we're not\ncontesting that, then I think your arguments from 1367 go away\nbecause 1367 just doesn't create the kind of distinction that you're\nasking us to create.\nSo either you lose as to removed cases too, or these arguments from the\ntext are just not going to get us to your result.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo we disagree, Your Honor, with your interpretation of the text of\nSection 1367.\nWe think Congress has ma de clear that there is supplemental\njurisdiction unless Congress has expressly provided otherwise.\nIt hasn't done that.\nAnd I think it's very important to consider how Congress came to write\nSection 1367.\nIt was in response to Finley, where this Court took an extremely narrow\nview of -- pendent-claim and pendent-party jurisdiction, pendent-\nparty jurisdiction in particular, and Congress said no, that's not what we\nwant.\nWe want a broader view of pendent -claim and pendent-party\njurisdiction. And that's why they wrote this very broad statute here.\nAnd it would be very strange to conclude that Congress intended to\nabrogate Cohill.",

Wellington:\nThat's correct.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThe part in the footnote, you think that's solid.\n### Katherine B.

Wellington:\nCertainly.\nThat's a really important point.\nSo that is addressed in (c)(2).\nSo, in (c)(2), where there is no longer a federal claim, the state claim will\nsubstantially predominate.\nIt could also fall under (c)(4), an exceptional circumstance.\nI would point out, Your Honor, that (c) is simply listing when district\ncourts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. This Court in\nExxon Mobil against Allapattah said really the key question is, is it in the\nstatute? And -- and, certainly, amendments to the complaint is not in\nthe statute.\nSo we think that's sufficient.\nBut, if you want to look at the text of (c)(2), I think that also answers the\nquestion.\n### Justice Thomas:\nBut -- but do you agree that when the district court dismisses a claim, it\nremains in the case?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nI agree, Your Honor. But that is also true of an amended complaint. You\ncan appeal whether a complaint was properly amended.\nWe cited the Lucente case in the Second Circuit that reinstates the\noriginal complaint on appeal.\nSo, if that's the test, we think that's met.\n### Justice Thomas:\nDo we normally think of a complaint that's amended by the party to\neliminate a federal claim as still having that claim?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nI -- I think that's true of all these circumstances.\nWhere the claim becomes moot, where the parties settle, where the\nplaintiff voluntarily amends, where the district court dismisses, those\nclaims, for the purposes of the party, aren't going to continue to be\nlitigated.\nWe think the important question here is: When do you evaluate whether\nthere is an original federal question in the case? Under this Court's\nlongstanding precedent going all the way back to St. Paul Mercury, you\nlook at the time of removal, Your Honor.\n### Justice Thomas:\nSo when does an amended complaint supersede the earlier complaint?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nYour Honor, we don't think that's the right question.\nThe question isn't whether it supersedes the original complaint.\nThe question is: At the time of removal, is there an original federal\nquestion in the case? We think that's what the phrase \"in the action\" is\ndoing.\nIf you look directly at Gibbs, which is where that language came from,\nGibbs is saying what you need is the original claim and the supplemental\nclaim to be in the same case. That's true regardless of whether the\ncomplaint is amended.\nThat claim was filed in the same case.",

Wellington:\nI think you're right.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nOr the other side can correct me if I'm wrong too.\nYeah.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nI think you're right, Your Honor, that there are different rules that apply\nin different circumstances, that they have different policy concerns or\nlongstanding prudential concerns and that this Court shouldn't go\naround disrupting those rules.\nThere are lots of different rules that apply with respect to adding diverse\nparties. Sometimes you can do that.\nSometimes you can't. You can add a non-diverse successor in interest,\nfor example.\nSo there's lots of different circumstances.\nAnd we simply ask the Court to apply settled law.\nWe don't think the Court has to come up with a unifying theory for all\nthese different areas of the law.\nCongress acted with an important reason here with respect to\nsupplemental jurisdiction.\nIt wanted to protect the defendant's right to remove.\nAnd I think that's why you see this broad text here.\nAnd as well as judicial efficiency.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAnd by \"settled law,\" you mean Footnote 6, you mean Cohill? Or what\nare you referring to there?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo you're right, Your Honor.\nSo St. Paul Mercury, Cohill, and Rockwell.\nThere are also cases like Carlsbad, where this Court expressly asked, is a\nCohill remand -- that's the phrase the Court used -- is a Cohill remand\ndiscretionary? I don't think this Court could answer the question yes\nwithout having, again, decided this question.\nThere are other cases like International College of Surgeons and Rosado\nthat, again, emphasize that this is a discretionary question. And I don't\nthink this Court should just depart from all of that precedent here.\nI don't think there's a good reason to.\nAnd this Court should --this is a statutory question. Stare decisis carries\nenhanced force in the statutory context, and that's why we've asked the\nCourt to continue to apply settled law.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThank you.",

Wellington:\nIt's a really important question, Your Honor, because what Congress was\ntrying to do is take into account the right of plaintiffs to be the master of\ntheir complaint but also the right of defendants to remove.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut Justice Gorsuch points to statutes that talk about remand.\nSo, even though the defendant has exercised its right of removal, there\nare circumstances in which that right is not given precedence.\nThe case goes back to state court, right?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThat's exactly right. It's up to the district court to decide.\nAnd we think in the mine run of cases where you amend the complaint\nright after you remove, there's removal to federal court, that's going to\ngo back to state court.\nWhat we're really talking about here are more unusual cases where it's\nbeen going on for a long time.\n### Justice Jackson:\nCan I just ask you about the text, moving quickly because I'm mindful of\nthe time.\nI don't understand how the question could possibly be whether or not\nthere is original jurisdiction at the time of removal. Of course, there is.\nThat's why the case gets to be removed.\nI mean, there's no question there that does any work because you only\nget to remove it if there's original jurisdiction.\nSo isn't the question really what happens when, after we've identified\noriginal jurisdiction and it's removed, the claims over which there were\noriginal jurisdiction drop out? Can supplemental jurisdiction be\nexercised when those original jurisdiction claims are no longer there?\nWhen we look at the text of 1367, I don't understand your argument\nthat supplemental jurisdiction arises in that situation because (a) says,\nin any civil action of which district courts have original jurisdiction, the\ndistrict court shall have supplemental jurisdiction.\nBut, in my scenario, original jurisdiction is gone.\nSo how can you have supplemental jurisdiction in a situation like this?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nI think it's really important to go back to the first principles that this\nCourt was applying in Cohill.\nIt was looking at St. P aul Mercury, which holds that you have original\njurisdiction at a particular time.\nAnd so, once you get original jurisdiction, you continue to have\nsupplemental jurisdiction.\nThat's what the Court held in Rosado.\n### Justice Jackson:\nor ever had original jurisdiction? It seems to be in the present tense\nsaying that you have to have original jurisdiction in order to exercise\nsupplemental.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nAnd I think that's because you have decades and decades of precedent\nsaying that in a removal context, you look at whether there's\njurisdiction at the time of removal.\nAt that time, the district court has original jurisdiction, and then the\nquestion is, will it continue to have supplemental jurisdiction? The text\nhere is framed in a forward-looking future tense, and we think \"shall\nhave\" does cover the situation where there's ongoing supplemental\njurisdiction.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThank you.",

So, like, what harm is this rule doing? And this rule has existed\nin every single circuit court for lo these many years.\n### Ashley C.

It's true that the lower courts deserve respectful\nconsideration, but a lot of these cases predate binding statutory text, so\nI'm not sure that that's dispositive.\nAlso, I would respectfully submit that you're the supervisory Court\nthat's most important in our Article III system.\nAnd when you're hearing a question for the first time, you ought to\nadjudicate it correctly, notwithstanding the respectful consideration\nthat you would give to the lower courts.\nAnd if you've determined, as it sounds like you have, that from first\nprinciples I'm right, the fact that lower courts that obviously can't bind\nthis one got it wrong I don't think is a reason to just say let's go along to\nget along.",

Wellington:\nSo Congress thought very hard about this.\nThis Court has long held -- had two different lines of precedent, one for\npendent-claim jurisdiction and one for pendent-party jurisdiction.\nIt has taken a very broad view to pendent-claim jurisdiction and very\nnarrow view to pendent-party jurisdiction. And Congress said that's not\nwhat we want.\nWe don't want Finley.\nWe do want some limits.\nI think (b) tells you that (a) is so broadly written that if you don't have\n(b), that there would be concerns about diversity jurisdiction questions,\nYour Honor.\nBut Congress thought very carefully about this, and it -- it made clear\nthat there would continue to be supplemental jurisdiction even when\nthe federal claims dropped out of the case.\n### Justice Alito:\nIf we thought that the Eighth Circuit's decision is right as a matter of\nfirst principle, what relevance, if any, would this line of court of appeals\ndecisions have in our decision-making?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nI think it's very important here because Congress is codifying precedent.\nIt's codifying these court of appeals decisions in particular in (c)(1).\nIt's very much aware of them.\nAnd the court of appeals decisions are reflecting this Court's decision in\nSt. Paul Mercury and Cohill and -- and now Rockwell.\nThis is incredibly well established. So I don't think the Court should\nignore that that's what the court of appeals have been doing and that\nthey're doing it for a reason, because this is a doctrine of discretion.\nIt's a matter for the district court to say, what are the fairness concerns?\nWhat are the comity concerns? What are the judicial efficiency\nconcerns? Maybe the district court can dispose of the state law\nquestions really easily and the case has been going on for two years in\nthe district court.\nIt doesn't make sense to send that case back to state court.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, this goes back to a question that",

Wellington:\nSo we think that it is forum manipulation, particularly in this case,\nwhere th ey waited almost two years to amend the complaint after they\nlose in the Eighth Circuit.\nWe think that's a form of forum manipulation.\nWe think there are much more extreme forms of forum manipulation,\nfor example, where a plaintiff -- you know, the district court says: I' m\nabout to rule against you.\nThat's what happened in three cases on page 16 of the yellow brief.\nAnd the plaintiff says: Great, send me back to state court.\nAnd that's a very serious form of forum manipulation.\nBut we agree, Your Honor, in many cases, the mine-run of cases, you get\nto federal court, you immediately amend the complaint, the federal\njudge is going to send that back to state court.\nWe're really talking about the more unique circumstances like this one\nwhere it's been going on for a long time and Congress wanted district\ncourts to consider different considerations.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you. Justice Thomas?",

Wellington:\nThank you, Your Honor.\nAs Justice Kagan says, under experience, Respondents lose.\nTo rule for Respondents on the question presented, this Court would\nneed to overrule or distinguish away St. Paul Mercury, Cohill, Rockwell,\nGibbs, Carlsbad, Rosado, Powerex, Osborn against Haley, International\nCollege of Surgeons, and Wisconsin Department of Corrections.\nThat's 10 decisions of this Court, on top of dozens and dozens of court of\nappeals decisions that have consistently and unanimously supported\nPetitioners' position.\nIndeed, even Respondents agreed that the district court could exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction.\nThey said it in their amended complaint.\nIt's only until the Eighth Circuit invited briefing on this that they\nswitched positions.\nAnd I think it's quite telling here that the Eighth Circuit reached the\ndecision it did by apparently missing all of the footnotes that it should\nhave read, including in Rockwell but also in the Second Circuit and the\nEleventh Circuit decisions that it cited.\nSo I think that's the reason we're here today.\nAs Justice Barrett asked, ruling for Respondents would also call into\nquestion the rule that applies in CAFA cases.\nThe court of appeals have said -- you know, if you get into federal court\non a removal in a CAFA case, the plaintiff immediately amends to try to\nget rid of all the class action allegations, the courts of appeals have said\nthat's a question of discretion for the district court.\nMaybe the district court will send a lot of those cases back to state court,\nbut maybe, when the case has been going on for two years and the class\nis about to get certified, that's a situation in which the district court\nmay say, okay, I'm going to keep this case here in federal court.\nIt would also call into question the Court's longstanding rules that\namendments to the amount in controversy do not affect jurisdiction.\nAnd what do Respondents want instead? So, instead of an approach that\ngives district courts discretion in every case to determine what makes\nsense as a matter of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and\ncomity, they want an inflexible rule that gives district courts no choi ce\nand that would subject the defendant's right to removal to the\nplaintiff's caprice.\nAs the Chief's questions suggest, where this Court decides to overrule\nevery single court of appeals, it should have a really good reason.\nAnd there isn't a really good reason here to upset a longstanding\njurisdictional rule that has worked just fine for a century.\nThe Eighth Circuit simply got it wrong, and this Court should vacate the\ndecision below.\nThank you.\n\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you.
