  "background": "Mr. Velázquez, a Mexican citizen, entered the U.S. without authorization in 2005. In 2011, the Department of Homeland Security sought to remove him and served a deficient Notice to Appear that lacked time and place details. In 2013, Velázquez admitted to unlawful entry and sought withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. In March 2019, an Immigration Judge denied these requests but granted voluntary departure within 60 days. Velázquez appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which dismissed his appeal in October 2021 and reinstated the 60-day voluntary departure period. On December 13, 2021, Velázquez filed a motion to reopen his case to apply for cancellation of removal, arguing he had accrued 10 years of continuous presence due to his deficient Notice to Appear. The BIA denied this motion, finding Velázquez had not asserted “new facts” and that the motion was untimely, filed after the 60-day voluntary departure period. Velázquez then filed a motion to reconsider, challenging only the timeliness determination, which the BIA also denied. Velázquez filed a petition for review in federal court, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit denied review, concluding that Mr. Velázquez failed to voluntarily depart or file an administrative motion within 60 calendar days, the maximum period provided by statute. 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(2).",

You don't need the common law.\nCommon law provides a background for what Congress was doing when\nit passed this law, correct?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nYes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd your answer is that when a word comes with old soil, you transport\nthe old soil.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's right.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\nAnd the old soil here, even according to the government, was that \"day\"\nwas defined according to the regulation.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's right.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\nNow the question is do we follow the government's new argument that\nthere's somehow a difference in how \"day\" is defined with respect to\ncourt obligations or -- I --I don't know where they get the word\n\"substantive\" from --or substantive obligations, correct?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's right.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nBut, if I look at the old soil, why don't I look at the law itself, the INA law,\nand when Congress wanted to talk about calendar days, it used\n\"calendar day\" instead of the word \"day,\" correct? I'm looking at 8\nU.S.C. 1228(b)(3), which has to do with the Attorney --Attorney General\nnot executing any order for expedited removal until 14 calendar days\nhave passed, correct?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI confess I'm not familiar with that particular provision, but our position\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd something like this would be a clear deviation?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI think it probably would be.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\nNow am I -- I want to go back to the jurisdictional question that Justice\nThomas started with.\nThe government didn't raise a jurisdictional -- this jurisdictional point\nbefore the Tenth Circuit, did it?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nIt did not.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd it raised it in its petition for opposition, but you didn't reply to it\nuntil your reply, correct?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's correct.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nHas this percolated among other courts yet?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI don't believe this particular issue -- well, I should say this.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nindependent jurisdictional basis, correct?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's right.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo hard to think why anybody would think they didn't have jurisdiction.\nBut, if we were to accept the government's ruling, do you know what\nother consequences this would have?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI think, if you accept the government's view of jurisdiction in this case, it\nwould be either a real sea change for immigration law because it would\nmean that reopening and reconsideration decisions aren't separately\nreviewable, as this Court has consistently pointed out in Reyes Mata, in\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nknow whether we would have granted cert if we knew it was one-off to\nstart with -- that everybody else appeals the order to remove, but you\ndidn't.\nSo I guess my question is, assuming we rule the way the government\nwants us to, do we know f ully the consequences of that?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI think it would be a lot of make-way arguments in the courts of appeals.\nThe government doesn't dispute, nor could it, that courts of appeals\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nCounsel, stop going to the substance.\nI'm trying to ask you a question.\nGiven that this is a new issue before us, isn't the best way to deal with it\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI agree, the Court doesn't need to weigh into the jurisdictional issue\nbeyond recognizing that this case falls within 1252(a)(1).\nI -- I do think there would be confusion if the Court were to side with the\ngovernment because the government doesn't dispute that courts of\nappeals can review this exact issue.\nIt just thinks you have to bundle it with other arguments.\nThere's nothing in the text of the statute that requires it.",

It just -- that -- that\nstrikes me as the difference here, that this isn't governing filing dates or\nsomething that you're doing. It's just saying that your authorization to\nbe in the country expires, you know, at that 60 -day mark.\nAnd it's not that the court was closed.\nI mean, your client could have departed, right?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's true.\nI can't dispute the factual premise that often somebody can get on a\nplane or drive across the border on a Saturday.\nThis principle is deeper than that, and there are several indications that\nthis principle is not just about court closures or filings.\nI think the best evidence of that is to go -- I'll start with the regulation\nand work outwards.\nSo the regulatory definition of \"day\" in Section 1001.1 says that\ndefinition of \"day,\" which builds in the traditional rule, applies to any\naction in immigration regulations.\nEven on the government's theory of how that deadline applies, that\nprinciple applies to things like getting married to maintain your visa\nstatus, regulatory deadlines for getting fingerprinted after you enter\nthe country, regulatory deadlines for taking a citizenship test.\nSo these are all things that are not filing, not court-related. Working\noutward from there, Rule 6(a), as we pointed out, also applies to any\napplicable statute and any court order.\nAnd so that, of course, covers things like filing in district court, but it\nalso covers things -- we give examples at page 18 of our reply brief -- of\ninjunctions that a court might enter imposing substantive obligations\non a party.\nSo say you're a defendant in a trade secrets suit.\nYou're found liable.\nThe court might enter an order at the end of the case saying: Defendant,\nyou have 30 days to turn over the misappropriated property.\nUnder Rule 6(a), that 30-day deadline clearly follows the traditional\nrule.\nAnd then working even outward from there, we have examples like --at\npage 28 of our br ief, cases like the Aetna case applying this traditional\nprinciple to deadlines under ERISA, which bind private parties, private\nplans, requires them to take all sorts of actions vis --vis each other\noutside the context of litigation.\nAnd then this Court's decision in Street, which applied this principle to a\nstatute that sets time limits on the President's authority to take action,\nas we explain in the brief, that statute in Street is parallel to this statute.\nSection 1229c gives the Attorney General the authority to grant\nvoluntary departure and then places a time limit on it.\nThe statute in Street worked similarly.\nThe Court applied the traditional rule there.\nIt should apply the traditional rule here.",

Yang:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1229c's\nmaximum 60-day period for voluntary departure is not extended when\nthe last day falls on a weekend or a holiday.\nThe requirement to arrange for travel and to depart the United States\ninvolves primary conduct in the real world.\nNothing prevents departure on weekends or holidays, when many\nprefer to travel.\nAnd unlike contexts involving the timing of litigation-based or\nadministrative acts before courts or agencies, no tradition by rule or\notherwise potentially exists for extending statutory deadlines for\nprimary conduct.\nBut, first, statutory jurisdiction is lacking in the highly atypical posture\nhere. Section 1252(a)(1) grants jurisdiction to review final orders of\nremoval.\nBut, in Petitioner's case, it does no t involve review of a final order of\nremoval.\nIt does not affect the validity of a final order of removal.\nAnd it does not even affect how you would implement a final order of\nremoval.\nMoreover, Petitioner has other avenues for judicial review of the timing\nissue here. He could seek APA review after unsuccessfully seeking DHS\nto return his voluntary departure bond or to adjust his status in the\ncountry. Now, on the merits, Section 1229c's test reflects the default\nrule that the 60-day statutory minimum means what it says.\nAnd neither common law tradition nor the definition of \"day\" for\ncertain regulations supports a contextual exception here in the context\nof primary conduct.\nSimilarly, there are other statutes governing similar primary conduct.\nThe 90 -day period to depart after entering the United States through\nthe visa waiver program or on a K visa to marry does not allow stays of 93\ndays. The 29 -day statutory period for a ship crewman to temporarily\nland does not extend to 32 days.\nAnd Petitioner identifies no examples of extending statutory periods for\nengaging in such primary conduct.\nNow Section 12 --the question whether Section 1229c(d)'s penalties\napply for failing to depart timely is a distinct question.\nThose sanctions apply only if the noncitizen voluntarily fails to depart\ntimely.\nBut Petitioner has not argued that his departure was not non-voluntary\nor if it was non-voluntary, and the 60 -day period itself cannot be\nextended. I welcome the Court's questions.",

Cedrone:\nWhat you have in this case is everything pointing in the same direction.\nSo start with the regulation. Section 1001.1 provides a definition of\n\"day\" that has governed since the creation of the INA and that\nremained unchanged for a decade before this particular provision\npassed.\nAnd the government even acknowledges now that other deadlines in\nthe same section of IIRIRA follow that definition.\nSo somebody picking up the statute in 1996 would have read the statute\nin light of that definition.\nBut it's not just the regulation.\nAs we point out, that regulation codifies an earlier practice that's\nreflected in Civil Rule 6(a), which this Court and the BIA have looked to.\nThat rule itself codifies earlier decisions, like this Court's decision in\nStreet, that recognized a general principle that when a power can be\nexercised up until a certain day, if that day is a Sunday or holiday, it can\nbe exercised the next business day.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nI'm sorry, go ahead.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nEncapsulated an even earlier common law principle.\nAnd so somebody reading this statute in '96 would have had no reason\nto deviate from all of those things, pointing to the same interpretation.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nBut your argument evolves, right? I mean, as I read your brief anyway,\nthe Sunday provision was pretty clear early on, but then Saturday kind\nof crept in there somewhere along the way.\nAnd so, usually, we think of statutory -- timing deadlines as not sort of\nflexible in that way.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nTwo points, Your Honor. First, I would just return to the regulation and\nsay that that definition, which was in place for years before this statute\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nRight, and I think that regulation encapsulates an earlier principle that\nhas not changed over time.\nSo the way I would frame the principle generally is that there are certain\ndays, you can call them -- certain legally recognized days of rest.\nYou can call them non-business days.\nYou can use the Latin term dies non juridicus.\nThat principle recognizes that when a deadline or time period expires on\none of those legally recognized days of rest, it carries over to the next\nday.\nBut the days that are legally recognized days of rest can change over\ntime. And so, with respect to Saturday, of course, there was a change in\nthe 20th century as Saturday came to be recognized as a day that's akin\nto Sunday, on par with Sunday.

There\nwere reasons for the rules about filing, because courts were closed.\nSome of the things that you mentioned are things that would be more\ndifficult perhaps to accomplish on a weekend.\nOriginally, perhaps the rule for Sunday was based on religion.\nYou might argue that it should be extended to Saturday if your counsel -\n-if your -- your client has a -- if that is that --is -- is a holy day, a\nspecial day for your particular client.\nBut I can't think of any practical reason why there should be a rule -- a\ndifferent rule for departing the country.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nYeah.\nSo I think there's two -- two practical reasons, one more substantive\nand one more procedural.\nThis traditional rule, in our view, stems from a general principle that\nthere are certain legally set-aside days where presumptively at least the\ngovernment can't ask people to do stuff.\nAnd so the persistence of this rule, even in the face of 24/7 e-filing,\nshows that this is a principle that's deeper than just impracticability,\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, I mean, that's -- that doesn't strike me as a practical reason. Why\ncan't they say: You've got to get out of the country in 60 days? You can\nget out of the country just as easily on a Saturday or a Sunday as you can\non a Monday.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI'll mention just as an aside some of the amicus briefs go into the fact\nthat it -- it may well be more difficult to travel on the weekends.\nBut I guess putting that aside, the second practical reason, the\nprocedural one, is that we're talking about deadlines with severe\nconsequences.\nThe question of how and when your deadline runs should be easily\nunderstood and easily calculated, especially when there are severe\nconsequences.\nAnd on the government's view, you have to undertake a case-by-case\ndetermination for each deadline in the regulations and each deadline in\nthe INA.\nMaybe I could give an example.\nSo there's a 180-day deadline in the regulations, Section 1003.23, a 180\n-day for seeking relief from in absentia removal.\nThat statutory dead -- that regulatory deadline doesn't cross-\nreference the statute.\nSo you might think, if you pick up the regulation and pick up the\ndefinition, you know how it applies.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, but that -- that --in seeking relief, that -- that's requiring you to\nfile some sort of a document.\n### Gerard J.

I\nmean, seriously?\n### Gerard J.

Circuit made this point in Sherwood, this rule is not just a\nlawyerly contrivance.\nIt's also meant to capture the way that things work out in the world, in\nbusiness, in society.\nAnd so just one concrete example.\nThe motion that was filed in this case was sent by FedEx priority\novernight on a Friday.\nThat means it gets there Monday morning.\nAnd I'm not suggesting that anything in our case turns on the vagaries\nof FedEx's shipping policies.\nIt's just to say that even in business, overnight on a Friday sometimes\nmeans Monday.\nThis is a principle that applies across the board.",

Yang:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Kagan:\nIf this Petitioner had wanted to challenge the view of timeliness\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Kagan:\ncourt, you're saying?\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nWell, he could have done it in -- in multiple ways.\nHe could have -- if he wanted to do it in the context of the removal\nproceedings -- not going to the collateral consequences, because,\nremember, he could challenge the withholding of the bond or he could\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nSure.\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nYeah.\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nYeah.\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Kagan:\nAnd how does he challenge that determination?\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nSo if --he could challenge the motion to reopen on judicial review.\nHe could have sought reconsideration and then challenged both the\nmotion to reopen and the motion for reconsideration.\n### Justice Kagan:\nOkay.\nSo let's stop there.\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nBut it wouldn't have -- okay.\n### Justice Kagan:\nHe could challenge -- he could challenge it in court, is the first thing.\nAnd then you said the second thing is he could challenge it as long as he\nincluded a challenge to his removability.\nThat was the second thing.\nAnd I guess what I want to say is, I mean, this strikes me as a -- a very\nstrange rule that you're precluding him from doing what actually\nseems, from the agency's own perspective, the sensible thing.\nIn other words, he's seeking exhaustion of administrative remedies.\nBefore he goes to court, he wants to make sure that the agency itself has\nthough t about this question sufficiently.\nAnd then you say, well, he has to attach it to a challenge about\nremovability. But he's saying he doesn't have a challenge about\nremovability.\nSo you're asking him to make up a completely meritless claim in order to\nget jurisdiction. And how do either one of those things make sense? This\nis a man who's really trying to, like, get the agency to focus on this\ntimeliness determination that has just arisen in his -- in the denial of\nhis motion to reopen. He did what I would think the agency would want\nhim to do.\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nWell, I will say that where this comes from is the text; that is, there's\nreview only of a final order of removal.\nThat's 1252(a)(1).\nIt then goes to Nasrallah, which interpreted \"final order of removal.\"\n### Justice Kagan:\nOkay.\nThat's -- that's completely non-responsive to the question that I just\nasked.\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nBut why -- our position is following the text and this Court's decisions.\n### Justice Kagan:\nOkay.\nWell, let me ask you about the text then.\nIs this a question of law and fact arising from any action taken or\nproceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States?\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nIt is.\n### Justice Kagan:\nAll right.\nIt is.\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nYeah.\n### Justice Kagan:\nIt is a question of law and fact arising from an action taken or proceeding\nbrought to remove an alien.\nAnd then it says: Any of those questions shall be available only in judicial\nreview of a final order under this section.\nNow wouldn't you read that to say that all those other questions that\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nNot if there's not a final order.\nIf there's not review of the final order of removal, it doesn't fall within\nthat -- that's what the text says.\nIt's available only in judicial review of a final order.",

      "dialogue": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you, counsel.\nRebuttal, Mr. Cedrone?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThank you, Your Honor. Let me say a few words about jurisdiction and\nthen a few words about the merits.\nOn jurisdiction, the question of whether there's going to be a blast\nradius from this decision, the government explains at page 18 of its brief\nthat it sees the jurisdictional question in this case as turning on two\nidiosyncratic features of this case.\nWhat the government has tried to do is construct a view of jurisdiction\nthat disposes of this case and no other.\nFor the reasons we've explained, that view of jurisdiction is wrong.\nThe Court doesn't have to do anything unprecedented to recognize as\nmuch.\nIt can start with the text of the statute, which covers a final order of\nremoval.\nOn the government's view, a final order of removal is just the piece of\nthe order that says you are removable to this country.\nI don't know where that comes from.\nin this case is the government's view, which appeared for the first time\nin a brief in opposition and has continued to evolve, including at the\nlectern here today.\nI heard Mr. Yang say for the first time that there's a voluntariness test\nthat needs to be adjudicated, and he cited a BIA case that I don't believe\nwas in his brief.\nThe reason for that is this is a rule that's crafted to dispose of this case.\nThe Court doesn't have to do anything different from what it's already\nsaid in previous cases to recognize jurisdiction.\nI also heard Mr. Yang say on -- on jurisdiction that jurisdiction is\navailable in a case where the question turns on how the removal order is\nimplemented.\nI don't know how to credibly explain to a client that the one -- the\n$3,000 fine you get slapped with as you're removed from the country\nand the 10-year bar on return is not part of how the removal order is\nimplemented.\nSo I think you can even rely on Mr. Yang's words here today to recognize\nthat there is jurisdiction.\nTurning to the merits, the government's main argument is that there's\nprimary conduct and statutes and regulations governing filings. I also\ndon't know where that comes from.\nIf you start with the regulation, Section 1001.1, it says it applies to any\naction.\nThe government tries to read that in a way that it only applies to\nregulatory deadlines and not statutory deadlines.\nWhat the government fails to grapple with is that many statutory\ndeadlines -- excuse me, many regulatory deadlines simply parrot\nstatutory deadlines in Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations and in\nplenty of other regulatory schemes outside of immigration.\nWe cite examples at page 42 of our brief where other agencies have\nadopted this same traditional principle.\nSo, at the end of the day, I think the question is, what would somebody\npicking up this statute in 1996 have made of it? That person would have\nhad the immigration regulation we've been talking about.\nThey would have been -- they would have had Rule 6(a), which both this\nCourt and the BIA have looked to to understand how deadlines work not\nonly where the rule directly applies but also in other cases.\nThat person would have had precedent from this Court applying this\ntraditional rule. That --that --that person would have had the common\nlaw principle that has applied even before that.\nAnd there is nothing cutting in the other direction, nothing that that\nperson would have looked to in 1996 to think that there was a different\ndefinition, a different time calculation rule that applied to this statute\nand this statute only.\nWe ask the Court to reverse.\n\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you, counsel.\nThe case is submitted.",
