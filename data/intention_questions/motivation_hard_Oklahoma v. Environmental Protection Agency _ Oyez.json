  "background": "In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) strengthened its national air quality standards for ozone, requiring states to submit implementation plans that would prevent their emissions from significantly impacting other states’ air quality. In February 2023, the EPA issued a final rule disapproving the plans submitted by 21 states, including Oklahoma and Utah, after evaluating them using a four-step framework designed to address interstate pollution. Oklahoma and Utah, along with various industry groups, challenged the EPA’s disapproval of their plans in their respective regional circuit courts. The EPA responded by moving to transfer these cases to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, arguing that because the disapprovals were published together in a single Federal Register notice and used a consistent analytical approach, they must be reviewed by the D.C. Circuit rather than regional courts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit agreed with the EPA that the challenged rule is nationally applicable, so it granted the EPA’s motions to transfer the petitions to the D.C. Circuit.",

Stewart:\nI -- I mean, we see the specification of SIP decisions in prong 2 as\nreferring to decisions regarding an -- an individual SIP.\nAnd to the extent that we publish approvals or disapprovals of particular\nstate SIPs on a one -- one-to-one basis, we would agree that those are\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo you think the statute was really meant to distinguish between 1 and 2\non the basis of the EPA's publishing determinations?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nWell, I would say that the statute was meant to distinguish between 1\nand 2 on the basis of the action that EPA took. And if -- if you regard the\nno, you should probably disregard it.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAre they materially different? If what the EPA did here was separate out\nI see one -- one publication that lists each state separately and has the\nanalysis for each state separately.\nIf EPA put a page break between each one of the states and published\nthem differently, would you say that's a sentence 2 scenario?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI -- I don't think a page break would be enough, but if EPA issued\ndifferent -- you know, 21 different Federal Register notices on 21\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nWith the same kind of content as to the nationwide part of it, and then\neach one with a different analysis, how does this content, the\nnationwide content apply to the particular state involved, then we\nwould say that's a series of discrete state-specific actions.\nAnd in -- in a way the most straightforward way for us to prevail in this\ncase ultimately is on prong 3, because the analysis under prong 3\ndoesn't depend on what if any weight the court gives to EPA's decision\nto issue these, all of these in one Federal Register notice.\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo on the thought, the prong 3 determination, what --what is your view\nas to why this is still driven? I understand that you have four factors and\nyou're applying the four factors.\nAnd we would hope that that would be the case, that you would be\nassessing each state consistently using a set of criteria.\nBut I take your point that that's enough to make it a --a determination\nof national scope or application?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nWell, I mean, it is partly that they were the four criteria we were going to\nuse.\nIt was partly that they at least to a degree were new and contested.\nWe anticipated from comments we received on the proposed\ndisapprovals that the states would contest the methodology, not just its\napplication.\nThe other thing I would say is all of the states whose plans were\ndisapproved had proposed to take no further ameliorative action with\nrespect to ozone transport beyond what they were already doing.\nSo it would have been a much more complicated analysis if various\nstates had been planning to improve their plans in -- in different ways\nand EPA was required to make state-by-state determinations as to is\nthis good enough.\nIn -- instead, we had -- we approved a lot of plans that -- for states\nthat fell below the 1 percent threshold, disapproved a lot of plans for\nstates that in our view fell above it and that didn't propose to do\nanything additional.",

Stewart:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Let me just\nmake two or three observations and -- and then take questions.\nThe first is that there's been colloquy in both of these cases about the\npropriety of EPA getting deference on a question about what forum the\ncase will be heard in. Under the statute, EPA has some influence on the\nquestion of whether the case, all challenges to a particular action will be\nheard in a centralized forum or whether, instead, they can be brought all\nthroughout the country.\nAnd if EPA chooses the former course, the fact that the cases go to the\nD.C. Circuit, the fact that the D.C. Circuit is the centralized forum, that's\nthe choice of Congress.\nThat's not the choice of EPA.\nAnd so it's not the case that EPA can direct challenges to whatever court\nit wishes.\nThe second thing I would say, and this goes back to the NRDC cases that I\nmentioned earlier, that when Congress was studying the venue\nprovision in preparation for the 1977 amendments, it had in mind the\nSIP approval actions that had taken place and been challenged in many -\n-in NRDC cases. And when it chose the path that EPA's general counsel\nrecommended, rather than the path that ACUS recommended, it\nwanted to ensure that there was some mechanism available for review\nof national issues, even when they pertained to the approval or\ndisapproval of SIPs.\nAnd, finally, Justice Kagan, you said something to the effect that under\nEPA's framework here, as opposed to the framework in the case before,\neven once you got past the 1 percent threshold, the 1 -- the questions\nabout the propriety of the 1 percent de minimis threshold, there was still\na lot of work to be done.\nAnd I think the analysis is complicated, but at the end of the day, EPA\ndisapproved 21 plans.\nIt approved, I think, 23.\nI believe that all 23 plans that were approved were approved on the\nground that the state fell under the 1 percent de minimis threshold.\nSo as a practical matter, the determination of whether a particular state\nexceeded the 1 percent threshold had great predictive effect in terms of\nwhether the plan would be approved or disapproved.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",
