  "background": "In 2012, California applied for a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement its Advanced Clean Car Program, which included two key components: a Low Emission Vehicle Program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 34% for new cars in Model Years 2017-2025, and a Zero Emission Vehicle Program requiring about 15% of manufacturers’ fleets to be electric cars by 2025. The EPA granted this waiver in 2013, and automobile manufacturers began investing to meet these requirements. However, in 2019, under a different administration, the EPA withdrew the 2013 waiver, arguing that state greenhouse gas regulations were preempted by federal fuel economy standards, that California’s standards weren’t necessary to meet “compelling and extraordinary conditions,” and that California could not show a direct connection between greenhouse gas emissions and its air pollution problems. After this withdrawal, several automakers like Honda, Ford, and BMW voluntarily agreed to continue meeting California’s standards due to their existing investments and growing consumer demand for electric vehicles. In 2022, under yet another administration, the EPA reversed course again and reinstated the 2013 waiver, prompting challenges from various states and fuel industry groups who argued that California should not receive special treatment and that climate change is not a “compelling and extraordinary condition” justifying state-specific standards. California, environmental organizations, and automobile manufacturers intervened to defend the EPA’s decision. The D.C. Circuit dismissed most of the claims for lack of standing, finding that challengers had not shown that their injuries were redressable by a favorable decision.",

Wall:\nOur rule is that when the government denies a party the ability to\ncompete in a marketplace and the party sues to have that market\nrestriction lifted, there is redressability because the party is asking for\nthe thing to be taken away that's causing its injury.\n### Justice Thomas:\nIs there some degree of hindrance to that party that has to be shown to\napply your rule?\n### Jeffrey B. Wall:\nI don't think so because we're not talking about just sort of some\nindirect impediment.\nI'm talking about a market restriction that directly tilts or forecloses the\nplaying field.\nIt says you can't sell your product, your good, your service into a\nparticular market either wholly or, here, partially, up to some certain\ncap.\n### Justice Thomas:\nSo how would you show that?\n### Jeffrey B. Wall:\nWell, what I'd say is it -- it's --you show it by the nature of the injury. So\njust like in a competitor standing case, like in National Credit Union, if\nyou come in and you say the government is under-regulating one of my\ncompetitors, right, this Court said that's competitor standing.\nGovernment agrees with that.\nThat's Footnote 2 of their brief.\nThis is the same thing.\nIt's just that instead of picking winning and -- winners and losers\namong particular market participants, you're picking winners and losers\nas among markets.\nSo, if you come in and you say I have something that yesterday I could\nfreely sell and today I cannot freely sell it as a result of a government\nregulation that directly forecloses me, you have standing on our view.",

I know you talk about it briefly in one of your\nfootnotes, but that seems to me to map on exactly with what you're\nnow saying. There was an exclusionary zoning restriction that prevented\nhome builders and others from building in a particular area, and the\nCourt found that that was not sufficient for redressability.\n### Jeffrey B. Wall:\nSo the Court looked at it more as a sort of predictable effects-type case\nand said, well, we actually think it's very speculative whether you could\nget into the neighborhood at all.\nAnd so the Court saw that case through a very different lens, and, of\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut I guess that I -- I -- I guess I'm questioning whether or not it really\nis a different lens.\nI mean, the Court said, if you're right that the rule is just a common\nsense -- you don't really have to have evidence, we just sort of infer\nbased on the relationships in the marketplace and whatnot, that's\nexactly what was happening there.\nThe home builders said we aren't going to be able to build our houses,\nour single -family homes, in this zoned-off area. And so we said, I think,\nwhen you look at the case, that there's got to be evidence that there\nactually would be home building in this area absent that regulation.\nAnd I think that's the same thing as saying here that you can't just rely\non the fact that we would think that lifting this restriction would allow\nfor more cars to be built.\nThere actually has to be evidence that there would be more cars built,\nyou know, fuel -ingesting cars, in this environment.\n### Jeffrey B. Wall:\nSo, Justice Jackson, what I'd say is the Court has sort of two lines of\ncases, and that's why we've made two arguments, because we think we\nwin under both lines.\nYou have some sets of cases, like the equal protection cases or the\ncompetitor standing cases, where you say that the nature of the injury\ngives you causation or redressability.\nIt's the ability not --you're denied the ability to compete in the\nmarketplace.\nYou're discriminated against no matter what would happen in the\nmarketplace itself.\nAnd then you have certain lines of cases, like Department of Commerce\nor Warth v. Seldin, where you say, look, we're going to look at what the\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd what distinguishes the two? Is it that we have corporations in one,\nthat we have -- like, what --how would we know which line we're\nsupposed to apply in this situation?\n### Jeffrey B. Wall:\nI think it depends on whether the Court believes that the nature of the\ninjury gives you causation and redressability.\nSo, as I understand the competitor standing cases, and I think they're\ncorrectly decided, if I'm in a market and I allege or show that I am\ncompeting with, you know, Mr. Klein in a market, and the government\ncomes in and tilts the playing field toward Mr. Klein, I have standing\nbecause, by definition, the nature of the injury is that the government\ntilted the playing field and I have redressability because I want the\nplaying field to be level again.\nThat's what I'm asking for.\nAnd we see our case as exactly the same.\nWe're -- and -- and -- and --- and I think the D.C.

Mr. Klein's looking only at California.\nThere are 18 states here that -- 17 others that have adopted California's\nstandards.\nSo what was the record on that? We had California's statement in 2021,\nthat's at JA 66, saying this is critical to reduce emissions. Then you have\nthe EPA, when it regrants the waiver, saying in 2022, California needs\nthese standards.\nThat's at pages 154 and 155 in Footnote 180 of the Petition Appendix,\nalso pages 64, 65, 180, and 202.\nIt says it again and again.\nNow I take Mr. Kneedler's point.\nThe EPA di d speak out of both sides of its mouth. It said, on the one\nhand, we're not going to really go back and look at whether they need\nthe standards.\nWe're just looking at whether we messed up a few years ago.\nBut they also say we've looked at the whole record and California needs\nthe standards.\nI don't know exactly how to square those statements, but either they\nabdicated their statutory responsibility or they said California does, in\nfact, need the standards.\nAnd then, in 2022, the two CARB declarations come in.\nI think the Scheehle statement at page 115 of the JA is -- is as good or\nbetter than the Vanderspek statement, California itself saying we need\nthe waiver because, otherwise, we get fewer electric vehicles and more\ngasoline -powered vehicles. Now I thought that the one thing they\nwould not clearly say -- and I can't tell whether California's just saying\nit doesn't need the waiver now or that was also true back in 2022.\nBut I didn't think that either of the -- either the United States or\nCalifornia would say, if we had not gotten the waiver in '22, no\nautomaker would have done anything from that day forward to the end\nof time, because I thought it was something that couldn't credibly be\nsaid by anybody to the case because whatever would happen in\nCalifornia, there are lots of other states out there that are not close to\nthe same numbers on EV penetration as California.\nCalifornia seemed to hedge on that,",

There is a 60-day time limit.\nWhat you want then is an advisory opinion.\nAnd at a certain point, we move from giving -- giving you relief or not,\nbut that's not this case.\n### Jeffrey B. Wall:\nJustice Sotomayor, I want to be very clear.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy would we announce a rule that's not pertinent to this case?\n### Jeffrey B. Wall:\nI do not want an advisory opinion.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo they now acknowledge that they were wrong.\nThey'll have to answer as to why they're even defending the rule if it has\nno effect, which is my logical question.\nlet them answer that.\n### Jeffrey B. Wall:\nI -- I look forward to hearing them do it.\nBut I just --I want to say quickly, in this case, everybody now\nacknowledges the greenhouse-gas standards persist into the future\nindefinitely if nothing changes from now to the end of time.\nAbsent a rule, they can come in and say: The market is exceeding our\nstandards right now.\nYou can't show that any automaker will do anything.\nThere's a 60-day time bar in the statute.\nIf we can't sue when we sued, we're out of luck forever.\nThe advantage of our rule is that it matches up with the injury perfectly,\nand it makes sure that in the future, if the price of electricity goes up or\nthe availability of rare earth minerals for batteries changes, we can\naffect the market.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nLet's assume that they had affidavits from every single car\nmanufacturer.\nThis is like Chamber of Commerce versus EPA.\nEvery car manufacturer, every single one of them, says: Can't change it,\nwon't change it.\nDo you still win? Can't change it, won't change it.\nYou're the fuel people, but it's not going to affect you because they're\ngoing to follow it no matter what.\n### Jeffrey B. Wall:\nYes, we do.\nThe evidence here is actually to the contrary, pages 99 to 211.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWell, but that's the point.\n### Jeffrey B. Wall:\nBut I -- I take the point. Yes, because the question isn't what are\nautomakers doing today when we get locked out of the market.\nIt's, yes, we have a pocketbook injury, we believe, but we have an injury\nthat occurs even earlier than that.\nWe are denied the ability to go out and compete in the marketplace, to\nconvince automakers that they shouldn't be making as many electric\nvehicles.\nThey should be making more vehicles that run on liquid fuel.\nAnd the government has foreclosed us from doing that.\nAnd it's no different than the examples we give in our brief.",

When someone says I'm threatened with -- you\nknow, I expect that this will harm me, we assess the -- the --the --the\ndegree of the risk.\n### Jeffrey B.

But, second, and -\n- and I -- more logically doctrinally, in the competitor standing cases,\nthe Court doesn't say: Well, if we leveled the playing field, would the\ncustomers that you seek to compete for fairly come to you rather than\nthe other guy? And I think that's the wrong -- I think that would be the\nwrong way to look at those cases.\nYour injury isn't just what happens in the marketplace when you are\nallowed to compete and you think some dollars are taken out of your\npocket.\nYou don't really know because the point is you've been locked out of the\nmarketplace.\nAnd that's why I think the rule is important.\nI think it's the same logic here as in the competitor standing cases.\nAnd it's not like the Court doesn't do that in other areas.\nCalifornia is here saying: If we are prevented from enforcing our s\ntandards --and this Court said it many times -- that is injury, indeed,\nirreparable injury, to the state. Without knowing what it will do under\nthe statutes, whether it will work, whether we'll get a penalty or a\nconviction, the Court often says: If the sovereign doesn't get to enforce\nits statute, that is injury, and the state's got standing to come in\nregardless.\nI would think that you -- you would have injury in fact under our cases if\nthe effect of this is to cause your clients to be unable to sell one car.\nWouldn't that be correct?\n### Jeffrey B. Wall:\nWell, sell one gallon of liquid fuel.\nYes.\n### Justice Alito:\nI'm sorry, one gallon of liquid fuel.\n### Jeffrey B. Wall:\nYes, that's true.\n### Justice Alito:\nSo that doesn't seem like very much to have to show.\n### Jeffrey B. Wall:\nJustice Alito, I agree, but that's what makes the case so odd.\nThe court of appeals said: All right, we're not going to contest that\nthere's injury in fact and causation.\nWe're not going to say there is, but we're not going to say there isn't.\nWe're going to assume that you've got injury in fact that you sell one\ngallon less of gasoline, and we're going to assume it's caused by the\nregulation.\nBut we think you haven't shown redressability.",

And, again, it showed that what the plaintiff was saying was\ninsufficient.\nWell, here, the plaintiff was saying: These 2012 predictions show that\nwe are injured.\nAnd our evidence and -- showed: No, that's not obvious, and there's no\nreason to think that's correct because the technology had already\nimproved, maybe thanks to our standards back during the preceding\nyears and years.\nThe market had already developed.\nMaybe it was our standards that -- and --as well as other things that\nmade auto manufacturers invest in developing that market.\nBut the -- the point is that by 2022, the cake was baked.\nOr at least Petitioners presented no evidence that there was -- that\nthere would be any likelihood of a change if this regulation were struck\ndown.",
