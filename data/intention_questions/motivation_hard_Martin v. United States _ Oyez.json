  "background": "In October 2017, six FBI agents, led by Special Agent Lawrence Guerra, mistakenly executed a no-knock search warrant at the home of Curtrina Martin and her family in Atlanta, Georgia. The intended target was a nearby home suspected to contain violent gang member Joseph Riley. Due to similarities between the two properties and issues with navigating to the correct address, the agents entered Martinâ€™s home instead. The SWAT team, in full tactical gear, entered the house, causing fear and distress to its occupants. They later realized the mistake and promptly left the scene, later apologizing and assuring the family that the FBI would handle any damages. Martin and her family sued the U.S. government and the agents, claiming violations of their Fourth Amendment rights and seeking damages under Georgia state law. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the decision, ruling that the agents were entitled to qualified immunity and that the Federal Tort Claims Act claims were barred by the Supremacy Clause and the discretionary function exception.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Thomas\n### Justice Thomas:\nHow broadly does the proviso extend?\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nWell, if -- if this Court reads the proviso in harmony with the\ndiscretionary-function exception, it doesn't expand any more broadly\nthan it needs to to make sure that those two don't come into conflict.\nBut, if the Court presumes that there is conflict, Your Honor, then it\nwould extend -- supersede the other exceptions.\n### Justice Thomas:\nSo, in this case, how would it apply?\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nIn this case, it would apply because the Court would simply say the\ndiscretionary-function exception doesn't apply to this category of\nclaims.\nThe law enforcement proviso does.\nAnd that's the end of the analysis for the second question presented.\n### Justice Thomas:\nSo how -- how do we know in statutory interpretation how far a proviso\nlike this applies?\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nWell, Your Honor, there are a number of -- of statutory canons of\nconstruction, and I think the answer to this specific question here is we\nknow that it extends beyond simply subsection (h) because Congress\nstated it as an affirmative freestanding rule as opposed to somehow\nbeing parasitic to the language before it in subsection (h).\n### Justice Thomas:\nWell, wouldn't you expect it to be placed someplace other than in one\nsubsection after a colon?\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nSo I would say as a general rule, Your Honor, the answer would probably\nbe yes, but the reason the answer is no here is because, when Congress\nenacted the law enforcement proviso, it understood that the only\nbarrier to liability for the United States was the intentional torts\nexception, meaning Congress's understanding of the discretionary-\nfunction exception is the same as the one I'm articulating here today.",

Jaicomo:\nYeah.\n### Justice Jackson:\nbeing, it was a wrong-house raid scenario just like the one that you are\naddressing here, I understand how you say that this should not be a\nsituation in which the claims are barred, but does reaching that\nconclusion require us to say that there can never be a situation in which\nthe discretionary-function exception applies in the law enforcement\ncontext? That seems to be what you're saying, those two are just totally\nseparate, and I -- I wonder whether the kinds of policy determinations\nthat I thought the discretionary function was about could arise in some\nlaw enforcement circumstances, albeit perhaps not here.\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nSo let me -- let me say a few things, and then maybe we can have a\ndialogue about how this would operate.\nBut, to answer your question, no, certainly, the Petitioners in this case\ndo not need this broader rule to be articulated for us to win this case.\nThis is the quintessential proviso case.\nThis is the type of case that motivated Congress, as we know from all the\nnews coverage and the language of --of the statute, to enact the\nproviso.\nBut, of course, we're offering this answer in -- in response to the second\nquestion that the Court granted here, which is asking categorically how\nthese two things interact.\nBut, to get then to that question, it -- it --it's simply the case that, as\nwe can see from this Court's precedent addressing the discretionary-\nfunction exception and the broader intentional torts exception since\n1946, there's been no overlap even between those categories.\nAnd so now we're moving into the space with intentional torts\ncommitted by law enforcement officers where there simply can't be a\nsituation where you're exercising the type of discretionary function that\nthe exception in 2680(a) covers where you're also somehow\ncommitting an intentional tort because those intentional torts will all\nhinge on some portion of the elements or defenses being there's a lack\nof legal justification, there's no probable cause, or something along\nthose lines.",

Jaicomo:\nNot quite, Your Honor.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWell, but that's what it sounds like to me because, if the other 12 are\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nprovisions of this chapter, and the chapter includes all 12 of the other\nexceptions, shall apply to any claim for a police officer's assault and\nbattery.\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nYes.\nSo, if I could clarify what --what I mean, Your Honor, as we articulate in\ninterpretive methods for how the Court could address QP 2.\nOn the first path, which is the harmony approach, there is not any\noverlap between provision (a) and provision -- subprovision (h), and so\nyou don't need to get into what to do if there's a conflict.\nIf the Court, as the government asks, assumes that there's a conflict\nhere, even though none was found below in the Eleventh Circuit, then\nour analysis would extend beyond the reach of subsection (h).\nAnd to address your specific textual question about the language of\nChapter 171, the government actually agrees with us at Footnote 3 of its\nbrief, where it says the appropriate natural reading of that means that\nthe Chapter 171 other than Section 2680.\nAnd the reason why that's the case is because that same language\nappears in the preamble of Section 2680, and it also appears in\nsubsection (c) and subsection (h).\nAnd so to take the position that subsection 2680 would cancel itself out\nwould require the Court to read that language differently in the\npreamble than how it would read it in subsections (c) and (h).\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nIt does seem to me that what you're asking us to do is to answer the\nquestion we didn't grant cert on.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nYou're asking us to say that an intentional tort is never discretionary.\nAs Justice Ketanji Jackson mentioned, I don't --I'm not quite sure that's\ntrue.\nThe -- the case involving the Secret Service agent who arrested\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\ndirectly appeared to be threatening, that might not be an intentional\ntort, a false arrest.\nAnd yet I think there's enough measure of discretion of deciding when\nsomeone could be a threat to the president or to some other protectee,\nthat would fall within the discretionary.\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nSo let me -- let me respond in a few ways, Your Honor.\nFirst was your --your -- your -- your note about the scope of the second\nquestion presented.\nSo I would -- I would say that our arguments here fall squarely within\nthat scope because, as we explained, to understand whether there's a\ncategorical application of one provision to the other, of course, we need\nto know what the categories are to see if they overlap at all.\nAnd that's not some sort of word games from us.\nIf you read the -- the government's BIO at pages 21 and 22, where they\npropose the language for what this Court ultimately adopted as QP 2,\nthey follow on with the next sentence explaining that what's wrong\nwith our position is that it mischaracterizes the scope of the\ndiscretionary-function exception. And so that question is not only\nexplicitly in the language of Question Presented 2.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWell, I --I'm not sure because that's -- there's a huge circuit split and a\nlot of judges talking about how to define that --the discretionary\nexception. Judge Bibas said -- has a -- has a wonderful concurrence in\nwhich he says it's been read too broadly.\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nYes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI might be sympathetic to that argument, okay, but I don't know\nwhether we should be answering it.\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nSo -- so I agree that we -- that the Court shouldn't be answering that\nbroader question.\nAnd -- and, to clarify, in our cert petition, we relied on Judge Bibas's\narticulation of there being three separate circuit splits.\nWe offered a fourth as well.\nAnd the one articulated in Section 2(a) of our cert petition is the one\nwe're talking about here, this question of whether the law enforcement\nproviso and the discretionary-function exception interact and, if so,\nwhat happens.\nAnd this Court, of course, granted on that narrower question, which now\nasks the Court only to consider what to do with intentional torts and\ntorts that are committed by law enforcement officers as opposed to the\nentire sphere of negligent torts that would also potentially come into\nplay.",

Wouldn't\nthat be a --a sensible course?\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nSo the reason I would suggest that the Court doesn't take that approach,\nYour Honor, is that that would effectively be the Court overruling the\nNguyen decision but leaving in place all the other bad decisions like\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWe would leave in place everything as we found it, to be sure. And I -- I\ndon't doubt that there's a interesting circuit split that might merit our\nattention sometime soon, but this is an awkward vehicle to address it\ngiven that it really wasn't teed up for us that way because of the peculiar\nnature of circuit law below.\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nSo I -- I would say, Your Honor, as the government argued in its BIO for\nasking this separately phrased question to be taken, it said this is\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nI -- I understand that, but I think it thought a different version of it was\nthe threshold question, and that is how far does the proviso extend,\ndoes it extend beyond (h).\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nI think -- I can understand how you had read it -- would read it\ndifferently, but I think that's what the government was asking us to\ndecide.\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nWell, Your Honor, I would just point out, again, at the BIO at 21 and 22,\nthey articulate this point and they say that resolving this question of QP\n2 is threshold to QP 1 because the Eleventh Circuit's articulation of the\nSupremacy Clause bar is effectively just an importation of what it\nunderstands the discretionary-function exception to be.\nAnd so, if this Court were to only address QP 1, it would essentially be\nresolving the question only for the Eleventh Circuit but leaving all the\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nNo, I -- I would answer both QPs, I think, but I --I'm wondering whether\nyou to argue below that the discretionary -function exception doesn't\ninclude unconstitutional acts, intentional torts.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nAnd that would be something you could argue below.\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nSure.\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nOkay.\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nI'll be up here. (Laughter.)\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWell, I've got a lot of friends who want to have their chance too.\nI'd also like you to address the government's suggestion that we\nshouldn't address the Supremacy Clause question because we don't\nneed to in this case.\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nOkay.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nYour -- your thoughts about that?\n### Patrick M. Jaicomo:\nSure.\nSo the first question on why the Court shouldn't simply say the answer\nis that there isn't a categorical situation for QP 2 and send it back is that\nthen we go back to the Eleventh Circuit, where the case law is such that\nthere is no constitutional exception even.\nAnd so you're sending the Petitioners back down into the Eleventh\nCircuit, where even the government agrees that the Eleventh Circuit\nprecedent, which we'll say it doesn't matter if the Constitution's been\nviolated, you can still act with discretion, is wrong.\nAnd we'll be stuck there with the hope of perhaps getting en banc\nreview of the Eleventh Circuit.\nAnd the government will have then short-circuited the Nguyen decision\nwithout having to confront the way that the discretionary-function\nexception actually overlaps with -- with the law enforcement proviso.\nNow, to answer the second question about why or whether this Court\nshould address QP 1, of course, it should address QP 1, but the point that\nthe government is trying to get the Court to decide QP 2 on its preferred\nnew text of QP 2, which is whether it extends to the other 12\nsubcategories, that would --that just goes to show that these two\nthings are basically the same.\nThe -- the Supremacy Clause bar of the Eleventh Circuit is just a\ndressed-up version of the discretionary-function exception, as the\nEleventh Circuit and many of the other circuits have too broadly\nunderstood.\nAnd so this Court can simply address, by citing to Gaubert, here's where\nwe know the line comes for the edge of the discretionary-function\nexception without getting into every nook and cranny to still say: Even\nwith that line, maybe the further line not fully defined, we know that\nintentional torts committed by law enforcement officers are not going\nto touch that form of discretion as Congress articulated in --in\nsubsection (a).",

There, I might agree\nwith you, okay? I'm talking about a wrong-house raid. He has the right\ntarget, the right house, but breaks into the wrong one.\n### Frederick Liu:\nRight, and it's because, as the courts below found, of a reasonable\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWell, that's the issue, is that consistent with Gaubert, and I'm asking\nyou to show --to explain to me how that formulation is consistent with\nGaubert.\n### Frederick Liu:\nWell, I would just run the conduct here through Gaubert's two-part test,\nso step one of the test asks whether there is a federal law, statute, or\nregulation that specifically prescribes a course of action that the\nemployee needs to follow.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nGo -- there is.

Because that's not the nature of the immunity defense that the\nEleventh Circuit applied here. It wasn't a statutory preemption sort of\nargument.\nIt was a, you know, basic sovereign immunity kind of argument.\n### Christopher E. Mills:\nI --I disagree, Your Honor.\nI think it was a standard preemption analysis, just like this Court's\ndecision in Neagle.\nAnd so I think Neagle is -- is a prong of this Court's statutory\npreemption analysis that obviously comes up more rarely than the\ntypical preemption cases, but it involves the exact same conflict\nbetween federal law says you must do this and state law says you can't\ntake this action reasonably necessary to do that.\nSo I think that there --you do have the same implied conflict that you\nwould in other statutory preemption cases.\nAnd -- and I think the private person -- you know, the -- the key there\nis that it's in like circumstances.\nSo, you know, as an example, I would point the Court to 28 U.S.C. 530B,\nwhich says federal government attorneys are subject to state rules of\nprofessional conduct \"to the same extent as other attorneys in that\nstate.\" And the lower courts and the federal government have read that\nlanguage --look at their BIO in 1613-23 --to mean that a preemption\ndefense is available even though the federal statute references or\nincorporates the state rules.\nThe government says no attorney can be subject to a state rule that\nconflicts with federal law, and because government attorneys are -- are\nsubject to them only to the same extent, therefore, neither --neither\ncan the government attorneys.\nAnd that's the exact same point I'm making here.\nNo private person can face state liability that conflicts with and thus is\npreempted by federal law.\nAnd so, within the scope of 2674, neither can the United States.\nBut, even if you set -- set aside the private individual aspect, you still\nhave the -- the third paragraph in Section 2674, which -- which\nprovides any other defenses, including defenses available -- available\nto government agents.\nOn the Petitioners' theory, Neagle, in the famous case where he\nprotected Justice Field, escapes liability because he had a federal duty.\nMrs. Terry, the wife of the assailant, could turn around and sue the\nUnited States for damages, and the United States would be civilly liable\neven though Neagle was performing his federal duties.\nSame thing in this case.\nIf the agents had gone to the right house, under their theory, and state\ntort liability would have applied under whatever the state law happens\nto be, the United States would be civil -- civilly liable for money\ndamages for going to the right house.\nSo I think that that underscores that there has to be a Supremacy Clause\ndefense available when the federal agent was -- was acting within their\nfederal duties. And --and then the last -- last aspect I would point to is\nthis Court's decisions in Richards and Hess, where --where the Court\nsaid you have to consider applicable federal law.\nAgain, the Court said that's the only way to make sure that the statute\ndoesn't extend more liability to the United States than that faced by\nprivate individuals or --or the government agents.\nand --and that follows directly from this Court's decision in Neagle and\nthe rest of the Supremacy Clause defense cases we cite.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Jackson\n### Justice Jackson:\nasked questions about, or this case, Gaubert doesn't apply.\nThe government gets around this by taking the position that the\nEleventh Circuit has taken, which is to say, unless there is something\ntelling you you can't do this, and the something either has to be a\nstatute or a clearly established law, you have discretion.\nThat's not what Gaubert says.\nThere's a whole step two to the analysis, which none of the courts in the\nEleventh Circuit or elsewhere that take a broader approach considered.\nOf course, there's discretion in the colloquial sense when police are\nraiding a house.\nBut that discretion is not legislative or administrative decision -making\ngrounded in social or economic policy.\nIt's the same discretion we see with driving a car or flying a plane or\nseizing horses in the Hadley case.\nAnd so it simply can't be the case that what Congress did when it\nenacted the proviso was to say: Even though the officers in this case had\na warrant commanding them to go to one address, there was discretion\nfor them to go to another.\nSo they should lose on step one.\nIf we get to step two, there's no question that there was no policy here.\nAs my friend said, the government's policy is to raid the right house.\nThey didn't do that.\nThe preparation is kind of immaterial to the ultimate result here.\nIf you really, really meant to drop the pizza off at the right address, it\ndoesn't matter, you still need to give a refund if you drop it off at the\nwrong address.\nEven then, if we look just to the concept of the conflict of the language,\nwe assume that there's a conflict, which, again, we do not think the\nCourt should do and the Court does not need to do.\nThe decision in Alaska is on point with this case.\nWe talk about colons and periods and indentations and --and the\npreamble.\nAll of that stuff was available in Alaska.\nThe government was on the wrong side of that case, and it made the\narguments we are now making, and those arguments prevailed.\nAnd, in fact, even the dissenting justices cited things that now support\nus here.\nUnlike in Alaska, where the proviso was limited to such claims, here, we\nhave an affirmative freestanding rule, as Justice Scalia requested.\nAnd unlike in Alaska, here, it doesn't --it doesn't matter that this was in\nthe middle of the -- the set of exceptions, because Alaska was the same\nway.\nThe Submerged Lands provision was (m), this other provision was (e).\nNone of that mattered.\nWhat's very clear here from the language Congress enacted and from\nthe fact that it took the time to add this amendment was that they\nwanted the claims if they satisfied the proviso to move forward.\nAnd it's crucial to keep in mind that if Petitioners win on this issue, they\ndon't win this case.\nWe're fighting to get a day in court where then we can duke it out over\nthe elements of torts and defenses in the Georgia -- under the Georgia\nelements standard.\nSo it's not as if this case being decided by this Court will even render the\ngovernment liable.\nWe still have more steps to take, but we want to be able to take those\nsteps.\nAnd through the law enforcement proviso, Congress --Congress said\nthat we should be able to take those steps.\nNow, on the question about the -- the second question presented in\njurisdiction, I can't say whether there's a jurisdictional problem, but\nwhat I can tell you is that when we wrote our QP and then saw the\ngovernment's suggested language for narrowing it, we understood that\nto mean our QP but narrowed.\nIf it was a completely separate issue that assumed the scope covered our\nconditional cross-petition. But we didn't, and we rightly understood\nthen that when this Court did that, it was narrowing our question to the\nspecifics that the government offered, as the government says at page\n22 of its BIO.\nThat narrowing still requires the Court to consider to some extent the\nscope of the discretionary-function exception, and if it doesn't, the\ngovernment's theory, which has prevailed across most of the circuits,\nthat anything that has any element of judgment or choice is good\nenough to get you into that exception means that the FTCA will become\nlargely a nullity.\nThis covers cases like the law enforcement proviso cases, but it also\ncovers the more run-of-the-mill cases like VA malpractice, where,\nobviously, a doctor has as much discretion to decide which artery to",

That\nexception, therefore, bars Petitioners' claims, and, because it does, this\nCourt need not reach the other question presented, which asks whether\nthe Supremacy Clause bars those claims.\nThe Eleventh Circuit resorted to the Supremacy Clause only because,\nunder circuit -- circuit precedent, the proviso in (h) modifies the\ndiscretionary-function exception in (a) and renders that exception\ninapplicable.\nBut, if this Court rejects that interpretation of the proviso, it should\nsimply affirm on the ground that the discretionary-function exception\nbars Petitioners' claims without reaching the Supremacy Clause issue.\nNow Petitioners have injected a third issue into the case, whether their\nclaims satisfy the discretionary-function exception in the first place, in\nother words, whether they satisfy the two-part test this Court\narticulated in United States versus Gaubert.\nBut that issue isn't fairly encompassed by the questions presented, and\nit's not independently cert-worthy.
