  "background": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe will hear argument first this morning in Case 24-316, Kennedy\nversus Braidwood Management.\nMr. Mooppan.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Task Force members are\ninferior officers because they are subject to ample supervision by the\nSecretary in issuing recommendations that bind the public.\nMost importantly, the Secretary can remove Task Force members at will.\nHis power to remove them flows from his power to appoint them acting\nthrough the director's authorities.\nAnd this Court has repeatedly recognized that at-will removal power is a\npowerful tool for control.\nMoreover, the Secretary can review Task Force recommendations and\nprevent them from taking effect.\nDuring the minimum interval period, he can direct the Task Force to\nrescind a recommendation, and he can replace Task Force members as\nneeded to ensure that happens.\nIn addition, he can require the Task Force to obtain his pre -approval\nbefore they issue any recommendation at all.\nGiven these collective powers of supervision, the Task Force cannot\nissue final recommendations that bind the public unless the Secretary\npermits them to do so.\nRespondents' contrary argument rests entirely on the statutory\nlanguage providing that the T ask Force shall be independent and, to the\nextent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\nBut, as this Court's cases make clear, that language does not create a\nrestriction on removing the Task Force members, and it does not impose\na bar on reviewing their recommendations.\nIt certainly does not do so clearly enough to overcome the canon of\nconstitutional avoidance, especially since the language itself\ncontemplates some amount of political involvement.\nIn all events, if that statutory language is the constitutional problem,\nthen the solution is straightforward.\nThis Court should hold that the language is unenforceable and\nseverable.\nIt is neither necessary nor appropriate to hold instead that Task Force\nmembers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the\nSenate.\nI welcome this Court's questions.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Thomas\n### Justice Thomas:\nBefore we get to the constitutional problems, what's the statutory\nauthority to appoint the Task Force?\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo there are two sources of authority, Your Honor.\nThe first is that under the Reorganization Act, the Secretary has the\npower to exercise all functions and duties of the director, and the\ndirector, under 299, has the authority to convene the Task Force.\n### Justice Thomas:\nIsn't that an odd delegation? Normally, it would be the superior or the\nprincipal officer who would have the authority who would delegate it to\nsubordinates.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nWell, it's not just a delegation, Your Honor.\nThe Reorganization Act was in place when 299 was enacted.\nAnd so, when Congress passed 299 and said that the director could\nconvene the Task Force, that meant that the Secretary could convene\nthe Task Force.\n### Justice Thomas:\nSo what --so the word --you're using the word \"convene?\"\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nYes, Your Honor.\n### Justice Thomas:\nWell, I think that normally connotes just calling a meeting or\nsomething.\nThe court was convened this morning.\nThe Chief didn't appoint any of us.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo I agree, Your Honor, that \"convene\" doesn't necessarily connote\nappointment, but there's no other language in the statute that specifies\nwho will appoint these members, and in that -- in light of that,\n\"convene\" is most naturally read to mean convene and select the\npeople who will serve on -- on the board.\nAnd that's clearly true before nine -- before the ACA.\nBefore the ACA was enacted, it's clear that the Secretary and the\ndirector had the power to convene these -- to appoint these individuals.\n### Justice Thomas:\nBut appointment would not be an issue if they had no authority to\nrequire anything of --of others.\nIt's just advisory.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nWell, not as a constitutional matter but as a statutory matter, and I took\nyour question to be, where is the statutory authority to do this? Before\nthe ACA, it had to be the case that the Secretary or the director had the\nauthority.\nIt would not be constitutional for the president to select and the Senate\nto confirm these individuals before the ACA because, before the ACA,\neveryone agrees they weren't officers.\nAnd the Senate has no constitutional power to have any role in the\nselection of a non-officer. So the only way to construe the statute\nbefore the ACA is that the Secretary and the director had the ability, and\nnothing about the ACA changed that.\n### Justice Thomas:\nCan you give me an example of another body that's selected this way\njust with using the operative term \"convene\" and that had been and\nthat the authority comes from --through a subordinate to the\nprincipal?\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo not off the top of my head, Your Honor, but, again, the -- as a\n### Justice Thomas:\nYeah.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nanywhere in the code that says who will pick these people.\nSo the most natural way of reading a provision that says he shall\nconvene the Task Force is to also select the people who will serve on the\nTask Force.",

Mooppan:\nI don't think so, Your Honor.\nLet me give you the most straightforward of them.\nUnder the statute itself, no recommendation takes effect until the\nSecretary sets the minimum interval period.\n### Justice Alito:\nRight, right.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nAnd the minimum interval period is at least one year.\n### Justice Alito:\nYeah.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo one year is more than adequate time for the Secretary, if he doesn't\nagree with the recommendation, to direct the board to rescind it, the\nforce to rescind it and, if the Task Force doesn't rescind it, to replace\nthem with people who will.\nThat doesn't seem very jerry-built to me. In addition to that, the\nSecretary also has the power to create a pre-approval requirement.\nUnder 300gg-92, he has rulemaking power to implement the statute,\nand he can say: Before you issue any recommendations, submit it to me\nfor my approval, and if and only if I approve it can you issue it in the first\nplace.\n### Justice Alito:\nAnd if -- if -- if Congress really wanted these Task Force members to do\nthe bidding of the Secretary, isn't that an incredibly odd way to go about\nconferring that authority?\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nNo, because, critically, we are not saying that Congress wanted the Task\nForce to do the Secretary's bidding.\nWe agree that the Task -- the Secretary cannot tell the Task Force to\nmake a given recommendation.\nIf the Task Force doesn't want to make a recommendation, it doesn't\nhave to make a recommendation.\nOur point is simply that if the Task Force does make a recommendation,\nthe Secretary can block it.\nIt's --to use an analogy, it's like bicameralism.\nThe Senate can't force the House to pass a bill.\nBut, if the Senate doesn't also agree with the bill, it doesn't become a\nlaw.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, under the argument that you just made, why can't the Secretary\ndemand that a particular recommendation be made using exactly the\nsame author ity that you just outlined? What am I missing? The\npresident says: I want you to make this recommendation, and if you\ndon't make this recommendation, I'm going to remove you and replace\nyou with somebody who will make the recommendation.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo he can remove them, but we don't think he has the ability to force\nthe phrase \"independence\" and, more importantly, the phrase \"the\nrecommendations made shall be independent\" in 299b-4(a)(6), we do\nthink that that language does prevent that.\nAnd that makes perfect sense.\nIf you take a step back and think about the statutory scheme, Congress\nwas, as it often does, balancing competing objectives.\nOn the one hand, it wanted the benefits of an expert body. It wanted\nrecommendations that reflected their best scientific judgment.\nBut, on the other hand, it recognized that you need to have political\naccountability.\nAnd so the Secretary can block it, but -- and that solves the problem.\nIt means that no final decision could be made that binds the public\nunless the Secretary approves it.",

I could say: I want you to make an independent judgment and I\nwant it to be free of political influence or free of outside influence.\nAnd by that, I would mean outside the Court, I might mean outside of\nour chambers, but I might not mean for it to be apart from me, not\nindependent of me.\nAnd I could even do that ex ante.\nyour --your best take on its interpretation, seen through the lens of,\nyou know, the way I interpret statutes, the way I see law.\nSo not entirely independent.\nIf you see statutes --I mean, so, you know, I -- I don't put a huge\namount of stock in legislative history.\nSo, if I say: You know, give me your best reading of the statute and that's\nwhat they bring back, that's not going to be very useful to me.\nSo they're not independent of me or my instruction even though I could\nsay they were independent in a very real sense of the word. But I take it\nthat you don't adopt that view?\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nSo, Your Honor, we could have taken an even narrower interpretation of\n\"independence\" along the lines you're suggesting.\nWe thought the better reading of the statute in light of its context is the\none we have articulated, where there is independence in the\nrecommendation made even vis-- vis the Secretary.\n### Justice Barrett:\nEven vis-- vis the Secretary.\n### Hashim M.

Mooppan:\nRight.\n### Justice Barrett:\nnecessary.\n### Hashim M. Mooppan:\nI -- I think that's right, Your Honor.\nAnd, again, ultimately, I think one way of thinking about this is this is an\nAppointments Clause challenge, so the question is whether there is\nadequate supervision.\nThe Court doesn't necessarily need to get into the exact level of what\n\"independent\" means and does it mean what you said or what I said.\nAll we -- the Court really needs to say is there's enough supervision that\nthese are properly understood as inferior officers.\nThat's all you need to do to reject the claim here and reverse the\ndecision below.\n### Justice Barrett:\nThank you.",

And we don't see how that can be squared with\nthe actual statutory language.\nMr. Mooppan suggests invoking the canon of constitutional avoidance\nin a way to bend subsection (a)(6) to make it more accommodating of\nhis view of secretarial power. But the constitutional avoidance canon is\ninapplicable here for many reasons.\nNumber one, Mr. Mooppan's proposed reading of subsection (a)(6) does\nnot avoid any of the constitutional problems that occurred.\nUnder the government's interpretation of subsection (a)(6), the Task\nForce members are still principal officers because they have\nunreviewable discretion when deciding not to recommend A or B ratings\non a particular preventive care service or when they decide to withdraw\na previous A or B rating that they have conferred prior to their decision\nto withdraw.\nThat means they have final decisionmaking authority that's not subject\nto direction and supervision.",

Mitchell:\nYeah.\nNone of the statute needs to be jettisoned in order to make it\nconstitutional even under our reading of the statute.\nIf the Court decides that Congress has vested the Secretary with\nappointment power over the Task Force, the appointments are still\nunconstitutional in our view because they're principal officers.\nThey have to be appointed by the president and the Senate no matter\nwhat.\nBut, if the Court even rejects that view, there's still the problem that the\nTask Force was appointed by the AHRQ director for 13 years between\n2010 in March and June of 2023, and there has to be some remedy\nissued for those admitted constitutional violations.\n### Justice Alito:\nSo that would be -- that would be for the -- what was done before\nSecretary Becerra.\nWhat about going forward? What would need to be done?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nGoing forward, it will depend on whether the Court thinks these are\nprincipal officers.\nIf the Court thinks they're principal officers, then they have to be\nappointed by the president and the Senate as well.\n### Justice Alito:\nSuppose we thought that they were inferior officers.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nIf the Court thinks they're inferior officers, there should be a remand, in\nour view, to the Fifth Circuit to rule on the question whether Congress\nhas vested the Secretary of Health and Human Services with\nappointment power.\nI don't think it's appropriate for the Court to decide that issue based on\nhow cursory the briefing is.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, suppose that -- suppose we do that, the Fifth Circuit goes back\nand says that, or we tackle the question and we say that the statute\nvests -- vests the appointment power in the Secretary.\nThen what?\n### Justice Alito:\nAnd what -- that's what I'm asking.\nWhat would the remedy be?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nThe remedy would have to be an injunction that restrains the Secretary\nfrom enforcing any of the Task Force coverage recommendations that\nissued between March of 2010 and June of 2023.\nEven the government concedes the Task Force was unconstitutionally\nappointed during that time.\nSo I don't see how the government can deny that we're entitled to at\nleast that much.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nIf the Court -- the remedy going forward if the Court concludes that\nthey're inferior officers and that the Secretary's been vested with\nappointment power, there should be no remedy going forward.\nWe only can get a remedy for those past --that 13-year window.\n### Justice Alito:\nOkay.\nThank you.",

Mitchell:\nRight.\n### Justice Kagan:\nAnd -- and also, Congress is saying to the people who -- you know, who\nshould think about the fact that this system works best if the Task Force\nmembers are treated as independent, but it's -- it's hortatory.\nIt's not saying that nobody can fire them.\nIt's not saying that nobody can supervise them and nobody can, you\nknow, prevent their recommendations from going forward.\nIt's hortatory.\nSo why shouldn't I read the statute that way?\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nWell, even if Your Honor read s the statute that way, they're still\nprincipal officers under Arthrex because, under that view that Your\nHonor is describing of \"independence,\" there's no authority in the\nSecretary to formally review and formally reverse the decisions the Task\nForce is making in either direction.\nAnd that's what Arthrex says is key. There may be informal ways the\nSecretary can influence the Task Force, such as removal or threatened\nremoval or other types of tactics, but Arthrex discusses all these types of\nand it says that's not good enough.\n### Justice Kagan:\nOkay.\nSo then I'm going to say then it --then your argument depends on a\n### Justice Kagan:\nWe're not dealing with every circumstance, every scenario.\nYou know, we're dealing here with a particular kind of officer.\n### Jonathan F. Mitchell:\nI just --I don't think that's an aggressive reading at all because Arthrex\nsays the touchstone for principal officer status is whether there is\nformal review available of the relevant official's decisionmaking.\nAnd even under the government's construction of the statutes, the only\nformal review that they're providing is formal review of an affirmative\ndecision by the Task Force to issue an A or B rating.\nThey admit that the Secretary can't reverse the Task Force if it makes a\ndecision in the opposite direction, a decision not to impose an A or B\nrating.\nI mean, that alone is enough to make them principal officers even under\nthe SG's view and even under Your Honor's proposed interpretation of\nthe word \"independent.\" At the end of the day, when you go back to\nSection 300gg-13(a)(1), it is the Task Force recommendation that\nmatters.\nThat is what is binding on insurers.\nIt is not the Secretary's decision that can bind insurers. So, even if the\nSecretary were to say: I hereby disapprove this Task Force\nrecommendation, that's useless when it comes to Section 300gg-13(a)\n(1) because what matters is what the Task Force says.\nIt's not what the Secretary says.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.",

Mitchell:\nWell, I'm happy to answer Your Honor's question, but, again, it's not\nproperly before this Court because it's not in the scope of the QP.\nThe government did not seek certiorari on the question.\nAnd at no point anywhere in the briefing or in Mr. Mooppan's oral\npresentation today has the government asked this Court to reverse that\npart of the Fifth Circuit's ruling.\nBut the ruling is nonetheless correct because the only entity that has\nthe power to impose preventive care coverage mandates is the Task\nForce.\nThe Secretary's role is only to determine when those coverage\nmandates take effect.\nSo for the Secretary to go out and say: I hereby ratify the Task Force\nrecommendations, that has no more legal force than if I were to produce\na memo that says I ratify the Task Force recommendations.\nI don't have any authority to impose preventive care coverage mandates\neither. Neither does the Secretary.\nSo the document has no force --that's what the Fifth Circuit said in its\nopinion, and that's completely right.\nThe other reason is notice an d comment.\nThe Fifth Circuit did not reach that issue.\nBut this is undoubtedly a substantive rule.\nIt's clearly a rule.\nAnd it's a substantive rule as well because it's imposing binding legal\nobligations on private insurers. It's prescribing law and policy.\nSo it has to go through notice and comment unless some exception\napplies.\nMaybe the good cause exception if the government wants to argue for\nthat.\nBut, again, they 've waived this entire issue, so I don't think they can\npossibly make that type of argument now about how an exception to\nnotice and comment might kick in.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nThank you.",

They had cause protection.\nSo Arthrex doesn't solve it for him either.\nTurning to the appointments question, I agree that it wasn't decided\nbelow and it could be remanded, but I think the colloquy here today\nmakes clear why the answer is quite clear and why it would be better to\njust resolve it now.\nMy friend says that the statute is agnostic about who can appoint.\nI believe he even said that the Secretary of Energy or a private party\ncould appoint these people.\nThat is obviously wrong on its face. Among other things, it doesn't\nanswer what happens if three different people all purport to appoint the\nsame -- appoint different people to the Task Force.\nYou cannot possibly read this statute to say it's agnostic about who\npicks the members of the Task Force.\nAnd given that someone has to pick them, the word \"convened\" must\nsuggest that the person doing the convening is the one who's doing the\npicking.\nSo then now all we have left is, is it the director or is it the Secretary?

And that's exactly what this\nstatute does two different ways.\nAnd if there was any doubt about this, Hartwell --this is an easier case\nfor us than Hartwell.\nIn Hartwell, as you pointed out, there was an inferior officer who had the\nability to make the appointment with the Secretary's approval on the\nback end.\nBut the decision in the first instance was vested in someone who wasn't\nthe head of the department. And yet the Court still said that that was\nenough to satisfy the Appointments Clause.\nHere, the Secretary can and, in fact, has exercised the appointment\nauthority in the first instance.\nSo, if Hartwell is okay, this is a fortiori from that.\nSo, for all those reasons, there's just no real good reason to remand this\nto the Fifth Circuit on this appointments question. There is no way you\ncan read this statute to vest the appointment in anyone other than the\ndirector/Secretary, and the Secretary has complete control in that\nsituation.\nA final point on remedy, we agree with Mr. Mitchell on this: If we are\nright that these are inferior officers, prospectively, he's not entitled to\nany remedy, and retrospectively, there will need to be a remand to figure\nout whether the old recommendations either have to be enjoined or can\nbe ratified by the Task Force.\nThank you.",
