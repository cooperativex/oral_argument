  "background": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe'll hear argument first this morning in Case 23-929, Velazquez\nversus Garland.\nMr. Cedrone.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The 60-day\ntime period in the voluntary departure statute works like any routine\nlegal time period.\nWhen the last day falls on a weekend or holiday, the period continues to\nrun until the next business day.\nCongress would have expected people to read the statute this way.\nIn 1996, common law principles, case law, established rules and\nregulations, and years of consistent practice all pointed to that\ninterpretation.\nIf Congress had meant to deviate from that traditional understanding, it\nwould have said so.\nEven the government now acknowledges that other deadlines in the\nsame section of IIRIRA follow the traditional rule in light of a long-\nstanding immigration regulation defining the word \"day.\" So the only\nway to adopt the government's interpretation is to believe that\nCongress used two different meani ngs of the word \"day\" in the same\nsection of the same statute.\nThere's simply no indication that Congress took that kind of split\napproach.\nThe government's interpretation would also spell chaos for regulatory\ndefinitions and deadlines.\nIn the government's view, even though Section 1001.1(h) provides a\nsingle definition for the word \"day,\" that -- the immigration\nregulations actually use that term to mean different things throughout.\nAnd so the only way to tell which deadline follows which time\ncalculation rule is to trace each deadline's history back through earlier\nand earlier versions of the code and Code of Federal Regulations.\nAnswering a question as simple as does my deadline fall on Saturday or\nMonday shouldn't depend on this kind of complex historical\ninvestigation, especially when deportation's on the line.\nThe default rule for weekends and holidays exists precisely to avoid this\nkind of case-by-case guesswork. The government identifies no reason\nand certainly no reason grounded in the text of the statute to depart\nfrom that traditional rule.\nThe Court should read Section 1229c like any other statute and follow\nthe usual rule for weekends and holidays.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

And I would make two points.\nFirst, as you point out, subsection (a)(1) speaks in terms of judicial\nreview of a final order of removal.\nThat's exactly what we're seeking.\nIf we win in this case, the final order of removal that binds our client will\nsay one thing.\nIf we lose, it will say another.\nAnd the second point is this Court has long recognized that BIA\ndecisions on reopening and reconsideration are separate final orders\nthat require a separate petition and are separately reviewable in the\ncourts of appeals.\n### Justice Thomas:\nIt seems that you're saying that a collateral consequence to a ruling on\nthis is a part of the final or der.\nHow is that?\n### Justice Thomas:\nThe order itself is not here, right?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI disagree, Your Honor, in two respects.\nSo, one, as I just pointed out, the Court has consistently explained that a\n### Justice Thomas:\nI thought we were talking about the 60 --whether there are 60 days or\n62 days to leave for --voluntarily.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's right, Your Honor.\nAnd the voluntary departure order at pages 42a and 43a of the Petition\nAppendix spell out the consequences if, on the one hand, our client files\na timely motion to reopen or, on the other hand, if our client fails to\ndepart the country or files an untimely motion.\nThere are two alternate orders of removal waiting in the wings, one with\nharsh penalties, one without, and this timeliness determination directly\naffects which of those alternate orders of removal will take effect.",

But a good\npart of your argument is tak ing regulatory provisions and applying\nthem to the statute.\nYou say that that is the appropriate prism through which to read the\nstatute.\nThe prism test doesn't sound very straightforward and clear to me.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nWhat you have in this case is everything pointing in the same direction.\nSo start with the regulation. Section 1001.1 provides a definition of\n\"day\" that has governed since the creation of the INA and that\nremained unchanged for a decade before this particular provision\npassed.\nAnd the government even acknowledges now that other deadlines in\nthe same section of IIRIRA follow that definition.\nSo somebody picking up the statute in 1996 would have read the statute\nin light of that definition.\nBut it's not just the regulation.\nAs we point out, that regulation codifies an earlier practice that's\nreflected in Civil Rule 6(a), which this Court and the BIA have looked to.\nThat rule itself codifies earlier decisions, like this Court's decision in\nStreet, that recognized a general principle that when a power can be\nexercised up until a certain day, if that day is a Sunday or holiday, it can\nbe exercised the next business day.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nI'm sorry, go ahead.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nEncapsulated an even earlier common law principle.\nAnd so somebody reading this statute in '96 would have had no reason\nto deviate from all of those things, pointing to the same interpretation.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nBut your argument evolves, right? I mean, as I read your brief anyway,\nthe Sunday provision was pretty clear early on, but then Saturday kind\nof crept in there somewhere along the way.\nAnd so, usually, we think of statutory -- timing deadlines as not sort of\nflexible in that way.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nTwo points, Your Honor. First, I would just return to the regulation and\nsay that that definition, which was in place for years before this statute\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nRight, and I think that regulation encapsulates an earlier principle that\nhas not changed over time.\nSo the way I would frame the principle generally is that there are certain\ndays, you can call them -- certain legally recognized days of rest.\nYou can call them non-business days.\nYou can use the Latin term dies non juridicus.\nThat principle recognizes that when a deadline or time period expires on\none of those legally recognized days of rest, it carries over to the next\nday.\nBut the days that are legally recognized days of rest can change over\ntime. And so, with respect to Saturday, of course, there was a change in\nthe 20th century as Saturday came to be recognized as a day that's akin\nto Sunday, on par with Sunday.

I'm looking at 8\nU.S.C. 1228(b)(3), which has to do with the Attorney --Attorney General\nnot executing any order for expedited removal until 14 calendar days\nhave passed, correct?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI confess I'm not familiar with that particular provision, but our position\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd something like this would be a clear deviation?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI think it probably would be.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\nNow am I -- I want to go back to the jurisdictional question that Justice\nThomas started with.\nThe government didn't raise a jurisdictional -- this jurisdictional point\nbefore the Tenth Circuit, did it?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nIt did not.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd it raised it in its petition for opposition, but you didn't reply to it\nuntil your reply, correct?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's correct.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nHas this percolated among other courts yet?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI don't believe this particular issue -- well, I should say this.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nindependent jurisdictional basis, correct?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's right.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo hard to think why anybody would think they didn't have jurisdiction.\nBut, if we were to accept the government's ruling, do you know what\nother consequences this would have?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI think, if you accept the government's view of jurisdiction in this case, it\nwould be either a real sea change for immigration law because it would\nmean that reopening and reconsideration decisions aren't separately\nreviewable, as this Court has consistently pointed out in Reyes Mata, in\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nknow whether we would have granted cert if we knew it was one-off to\nstart with -- that everybody else appeals the order to remove, but you\ndidn't.\nSo I guess my question is, assuming we rule the way the government\nwants us to, do we know f ully the consequences of that?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI think it would be a lot of make-way arguments in the courts of appeals.\nThe government doesn't dispute, nor could it, that courts of appeals\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nCounsel, stop going to the substance.\nI'm trying to ask you a question.\nGiven that this is a new issue before us, isn't the best way to deal with it\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI agree, the Court doesn't need to weigh into the jurisdictional issue\nbeyond recognizing that this case falls within 1252(a)(1).\nI -- I do think there would be confusion if the Court were to side with the\ngovernment because the government doesn't dispute that courts of\nappeals can review this exact issue.\nIt just thinks you have to bundle it with other arguments.\nThere's nothing in the text of the statute that requires it.",

Cedrone:\nThat's true.\nI can't dispute the factual premise that often somebody can get on a\nplane or drive across the border on a Saturday.\nThis principle is deeper than that, and there are several indications that\nthis principle is not just about court closures or filings.\nI think the best evidence of that is to go -- I'll start with the regulation\nand work outwards.\nSo the regulatory definition of \"day\" in Section 1001.1 says that\ndefinition of \"day,\" which builds in the traditional rule, applies to any\naction in immigration regulations.\nEven on the government's theory of how that deadline applies, that\nprinciple applies to things like getting married to maintain your visa\nstatus, regulatory deadlines for getting fingerprinted after you enter\nthe country, regulatory deadlines for taking a citizenship test.\nSo these are all things that are not filing, not court-related. Working\noutward from there, Rule 6(a), as we pointed out, also applies to any\napplicable statute and any court order.\nAnd so that, of course, covers things like filing in district court, but it\nalso covers things -- we give examples at page 18 of our reply brief -- of\ninjunctions that a court might enter imposing substantive obligations\non a party.\nSo say you're a defendant in a trade secrets suit.\nYou're found liable.\nThe court might enter an order at the end of the case saying: Defendant,\nyou have 30 days to turn over the misappropriated property.\nUnder Rule 6(a), that 30-day deadline clearly follows the traditional\nrule.\nAnd then working even outward from there, we have examples like --at\npage 28 of our br ief, cases like the Aetna case applying this traditional\nprinciple to deadlines under ERISA, which bind private parties, private\nplans, requires them to take all sorts of actions vis --vis each other\noutside the context of litigation.\nAnd then this Court's decision in Street, which applied this principle to a\nstatute that sets time limits on the President's authority to take action,\nas we explain in the brief, that statute in Street is parallel to this statute.\nSection 1229c gives the Attorney General the authority to grant\nvoluntary departure and then places a time limit on it.\nThe statute in Street worked similarly.\nThe Court applied the traditional rule there.\nIt should apply the traditional rule here.",

Cedrone:\nYeah.\nSo I think there's two -- two practical reasons, one more substantive\nand one more procedural.\nThis traditional rule, in our view, stems from a general principle that\nthere are certain legally set-aside days where presumptively at least the\ngovernment can't ask people to do stuff.\nAnd so the persistence of this rule, even in the face of 24/7 e-filing,\nshows that this is a principle that's deeper than just impracticability,\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, I mean, that's -- that doesn't strike me as a practical reason.

I\nmean, seriously?\n### Gerard J.

Cedrone:\nYes, I would, and -- and let me make two other points.\nOne is that for a noncitizen in immigration proceedings, even on the\ngovernment's view, basically, every deadline up until this final order\nfollows the traditional rule.\nSo, if you're a noncitizen going through immigration proceedings, you\nknow my brief is due on a Saturday; that means it's due on a Monday.\nI need to file an appeal on a Saturday; that means it's due on a Monday.\nIt's only this very last deadline that follows a different rule.\nSo I do think that would be a trap for the unwary.\nAnd the last point I would make is that, yes, I think, when you have\neverything consistently pointing in the same way not just in the law, but\nthe D.C. Circuit made this point in Sherwood, this rule is not just a\nlawyerly contrivance.\nIt's also meant to capture the way that things work out in the world, in\nbusiness, in society.\nAnd so just one concrete example.\nThe motion that was filed in this case was sent by FedEx priority\novernight on a Friday.\nThat means it gets there Monday morning.\nAnd I'm not suggesting that anything in our case turns on the vagaries\nof FedEx's shipping policies.\nIt's just to say that even in business, overnight on a Friday sometimes\nmeans Monday.\nThis is a principle that applies across the board.",

Yang:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1229c's\nmaximum 60-day period for voluntary departure is not extended when\nthe last day falls on a weekend or a holiday.\nThe requirement to arrange for travel and to depart the United States\ninvolves primary conduct in the real world.\nNothing prevents departure on weekends or holidays, when many\nprefer to travel.\nAnd unlike contexts involving the timing of litigation-based or\nadministrative acts before courts or agencies, no tradition by rule or\notherwise potentially exists for extending statutory deadlines for\nprimary conduct.\nBut, first, statutory jurisdiction is lacking in the highly atypical posture\nhere. Section 1252(a)(1) grants jurisdiction to review final orders of\nremoval.\nBut, in Petitioner's case, it does no t involve review of a final order of\nremoval.\nIt does not affect the validity of a final order of removal.\nAnd it does not even affect how you would implement a final order of\nremoval.\nMoreover, Petitioner has other avenues for judicial review of the timing\nissue here. He could seek APA review after unsuccessfully seeking DHS\nto return his voluntary departure bond or to adjust his status in the\ncountry. Now, on the merits, Section 1229c's test reflects the default\nrule that the 60-day statutory minimum means what it says.\nAnd neither common law tradition nor the definition of \"day\" for\ncertain regulations supports a contextual exception here in the context\nof primary conduct.\nSimilarly, there are other statutes governing similar primary conduct.\nThe 90 -day period to depart after entering the United States through\nthe visa waiver program or on a K visa to marry does not allow stays of 93\ndays. The 29 -day statutory period for a ship crewman to temporarily\nland does not extend to 32 days.\nAnd Petitioner identifies no examples of extending statutory periods for\nengaging in such primary conduct.\nNow Section 12 --the question whether Section 1229c(d)'s penalties\napply for failing to depart timely is a distinct question.\nThose sanctions apply only if the noncitizen voluntarily fails to depart\ntimely.\nBut Petitioner has not argued that his departure was not non-voluntary\nor if it was non-voluntary, and the 60 -day period itself cannot be\nextended.

Yang:\nAnd, in addition, where you have judicial review elsewhere, Congress\nwould have thought that those collateral consequences could be\npursued but in a different judicial forum in a different way.\nIt's not unusual here, when --we're talking about removal proc\needings, where it doesn't affect the order of removal in any way. It really\ndoesn't.\nThis is all collateral. This order of removal is unchanged. There's not a\nword on that page in, what is it, 42 and 43a that would change. Nothing.\nThey say it would change.\nBut, like, how are you going to change it? Notice: If you fail to voluntary\ndepart, the following will happen.\nThat's right, nothing's changing there.",

Yang:\nThe order doesn't change. It's n o different than a sentence, a criminal\nsentence.\nIf the criminal sentence says: We're going to impose supervised release,\nand if you commit a federal crime while on supervised release, it's a\nviolation.\nThat judgment doesn't say you've committed another federal crime.\nYou've got to wait for a separate order about whether or not you\nviolated the terms of supervised release. That's the same here.\nThis is simply saying: If the following happens, these are consequences.\nThe -- the separate order that really addresses whether they happened\nis the motion to reopen, which they're not challenging, and a motion for\nreconsideration, which they are.\nAnd that's the only thing they're challenging, and it doesn't affect the\nfinal order of removal.\nI think it's also important to just note the consequences or the penalty\nthat's imposed by c(d) of a monetary sanction or ineligibility for certain\nrelief, like cancellation and adjustment of status, only applies if the\nnoncitizen voluntarily fails to depart in the time period specified.\nAnd the Board has interpreted that provision in a case called Zmijewska.\nIt's 21 I&N Decision 89.\nAnd the court --the Board said: You do not voluntarily fail to depart if,\nthrough no fault of your own, you're unaware of the grant of voluntary\ndeparture or you're physically unable to depart.\nSo my point by this discursion is to explain that whether or not the\nnoncitizen is subject to these penalties is a separate inquiry.",

Yang:\nSo our position in Nasrallah was that all rulings in a removal proceeding\nwere within the ambit of the term \"final order of removal.\" And we were\ndoing that because there were exclusions of review of final orders of\nremoval.\nAnd the court rejected that argument. The court said: The term \"final\norder of removal\" in 1252 is something more limited, relying on the\nstatutory definition.\nIt is, one, things that find -- rulings that find the citizen --noncitizen\ndeportable or order deportation.\nThose are -- that's it. Now, in addition, Nasrallah says that things that\naffect the validity of the final order will merge in the final order.\nAnd we would like to extend that to some other things too.\nWe think that if you raise an issue together with, under (b)(9), the zipper\nclause helps you, because it says you can raise it in judicial review of a\nfinal order of removal.\nBut you still have to have a final order of removal you're seeking review\nAnd we think things like withholding of removal, where it affects how\nyou implement the final order of removal, even though it doesn't affect\nthe validity of the final order of removal, that's close enough because\nwe need to know how to implement the final order.\nThat is part of judicial review of the final order of removal under the\nzipper clause.\nSo those are the things that we think get covered, but all of them point\nback to some -- a final order of removal, and the reason is, is because\nthe jurisdictional provision in 1252(a)(1) only grants jurisdiction over\nreview of a final order of removal.\nThat's it.",

      "dialogue": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you, counsel.\nRebuttal, Mr. Cedrone?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThank you, Your Honor. Let me say a few words about jurisdiction and\nthen a few words about the merits.\nOn jurisdiction, the question of whether there's going to be a blast\nradius from this decision, the government explains at page 18 of its brief\nthat it sees the jurisdictional question in this case as turning on two\nidiosyncratic features of this case.\nWhat the government has tried to do is construct a view of jurisdiction\nthat disposes of this case and no other.\nFor the reasons we've explained, that view of jurisdiction is wrong.\nThe Court doesn't have to do anything unprecedented to recognize as\nmuch.\nIt can start with the text of the statute, which covers a final order of\nremoval.\nOn the government's view, a final order of removal is just the piece of\nthe order that says you are removable to this country.\nI don't know where that comes from.\nin this case is the government's view, which appeared for the first time\nin a brief in opposition and has continued to evolve, including at the\nlectern here today.\nI heard Mr. Yang say for the first time that there's a voluntariness test\nthat needs to be adjudicated, and he cited a BIA case that I don't believe\nwas in his brief.\nThe reason for that is this is a rule that's crafted to dispose of this case.\nThe Court doesn't have to do anything different from what it's already\nsaid in previous cases to recognize jurisdiction.\nI also heard Mr. Yang say on -- on jurisdiction that jurisdiction is\navailable in a case where the question turns on how the removal order is\nimplemented.\nI don't know how to credibly explain to a client that the one -- the\n$3,000 fine you get slapped with as you're removed from the country\nand the 10-year bar on return is not part of how the removal order is\nimplemented.\nSo I think you can even rely on Mr. Yang's words here today to recognize\nthat there is jurisdiction.\nTurning to the merits, the government's main argument is that there's\nprimary conduct and statutes and regulations governing filings. I also\ndon't know where that comes from.\nIf you start with the regulation, Section 1001.1, it says it applies to any\naction.\nThe government tries to read that in a way that it only applies to\nregulatory deadlines and not statutory deadlines.\nWhat the government fails to grapple with is that many statutory\ndeadlines -- excuse me, many regulatory deadlines simply parrot\nstatutory deadlines in Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations and in\nplenty of other regulatory schemes outside of immigration.\nWe cite examples at page 42 of our brief where other agencies have\nadopted this same traditional principle.\nSo, at the end of the day, I think the question is, what would somebody\npicking up this statute in 1996 have made of it? That person would have\nhad the immigration regulation we've been talking about.\nThey would have been -- they would have had Rule 6(a), which both this\nCourt and the BIA have looked to to understand how deadlines work not\nonly where the rule directly applies but also in other cases.\nThat person would have had precedent from this Court applying this\ntraditional rule. That --that --that person would have had the common\nlaw principle that has applied even before that.\nAnd there is nothing cutting in the other direction, nothing that that\nperson would have looked to in 1996 to think that there was a different\ndefinition, a different time calculation rule that applied to this statute\nand this statute only.\nWe ask the Court to reverse.\n\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you, counsel.\nThe case is submitted.",
