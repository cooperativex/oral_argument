  "background": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe'll hear argument first this morning in Case 23-1239, Barnes versus\nFelix.\nMr. Zelinsky.\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We are here today because\nAshtian Barnes was shot and killed on the side of a Texas highway after\nbeing pulled over for unpaid tolls.\nThe question before this Court is how to determine whether Ashtian's\nFourth Amendment rights were violated.\nThe Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable seizures.\nJustice Scalia was no fan of a totality-of-the-circumstances test, but, in\nScott, Justice Scalia made clear that courts must \"slosh through the\nfact-bound morass of reasonableness.\" In this case, the district court\nand the Fifth Circuit didn't do that.\nInstead, they applied the \"moment of the threat\" doctrine. According\nto the Fifth Circuit decision below, \"we may only ask whether Officer\nFelix was in danger at the moment of the threat,\" and \"any of the\nofficer's actions leading up to the shooting are not relevant.\" This kind\nof legal amnesia is incompatible with precedent, conflicts with common\nlaw, and defies common sense.\nUntil now, Respondents had embraced the \"moment of the threat\"\ndoctrine, but, before this Court, Respondents have abruptly shifted\nposition. They now argue that courts should look to what occurs before\nthe moment of the threat and apply the law of self-defense and\nsuperseding cause. Absolutely none of this appears in the decision\nbelow.\nAll of it confirms why the \"moment of the threat\" doctrine is so wrong.\nFinally, as Judge Higginbotham underscored in his concurrence, the\nfacts show that Officer Felix acted unreasonably.\nBut this is a court of review, not of first view.\nThe Court should rule for Petitioner on the sole question presented and\nremand for the lower courts to apply the correct constitutional\nstandard. I welcome this Court's questions.",

Zelinsky:\nJustice Thomas, we think the standard is the \"totality of the\ncircumstances\" standard that this Court articulated in Graham and\nGarner, Scott, and Plumhoff.\nIn this particular case, it would require looking at more than just the two\nseconds in which Officer Felix was on the moving vehicle.\n### Justice Thomas:\nHow much more than the -- than the last two seconds?\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nJustice Thomas, if you include an extra three seconds, then you would\nlook at the seizure in its totality.\nI think that this Court shouldn't be drawing bright -line rules on exactly\nhow much of the seizure should or shouldn't come in.\nThat's what Justice Scalia underscored in Scott.\nThere are no rigid rules.\nAnd courts can apply ordinary principles of relevancy and proximate\ncause to determine the -- the reasonableness of a seizure.",

First, the highway was a camera -controlled\nhighway.\nSo you can monitor all the cars by camera.\nThat's, in fact, how Ashtian Barnes was pulled over in the first place.\nThe cameras automatically identified his car as one with unpaid tolls.\nSecond, he could have radioed to somebody else on the road to follow\nAshtian Barnes.\nThird, he could have gotten back into his squad car and followed him.\nAnd, fourth, they also had the car's license plate.\nSo we're not suggesting that somebody should just get away scot-free,\nbut it is unreasonable to use deadly force because what happened was\nOfficer Felix put himself in a position where he had no alternative but to\nshoot the driver.\nAnd that's unreasonable, and you have to look at the whole picture, not\njust the two seconds in which he's on the car.",

Zelinsky:\nSo, Justice Alito, we had brought a predicate claim below about the\ndrawing of the firearm.\nMy friends on the other side have suggested we should have brought a\npredicate claim based on the jumping onto the car.\nBut, at the end of the day, I don't think that it matters whether there is a\npredicate claim because, in the -- let me give you an analogy.\nIn the search context, you have an obligation to knock before you\nsearch.\nThere's no freestanding requirement under the Fourth Amendment if\nyou're an officer standing outside a door to knock.\nBut, if you are going to engage in a search, we evaluate the\nreasonableness of that search by looking a couple seconds before, did\nyou knock? here.\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nIt's the same thing\n### Justice Alito:\nThe reason for the question is to probe whether you are using the term\n\"unreasonable\" in a sense that's different from the sense in which the\nFourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. So\n\"unreasonable\" has a particular meaning when the Court has to decide\nwhether there was a Fourth Amendment violation.\nBut, in lay speech, \"unreasonable\" could go to whether the action was\nprudent, whether it was a violation of best police practices or the\npractices of a particular police department.\nThose are not necessarily the same thing.\nIn fact, it seems that they're probably different.\nSo you are eliding these two different meanings of \"reasonable.\" Now\nmaybe that's -- maybe that's sound.\nMaybe that's unsound.\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nJustice Alito, what we're asking for is the standard that this Court has\napplied in Garner, Graham, and Scott and Plumhoff, which is you have to\nlook at the -- the balance here.\nThere's, on the one side, the state interest in seizing someone in a\nparticular manner.\nOn the other side, there is the harm to the suspect, here, the ultimate\nharm, the loss of his life. The problem in this case is that the Fifth Circuit\ncouldn't engage in that core balancing because it couldn't ask was there\na really pressing reason for an officer to jump onto a car and give himself\nno other opportunity but to shoot the driver.\n### Justice Alito:\nit is wrong for a court to look just at the moment of the threat, that the\ncourt has to judge the reasonableness of the alleged unreasonable\nseizure based on -- taking into account to whatever extent they are\nrelevant the events that occurred before that? Would you be satisfied if\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nOne hundred percent.\nI think it would be helpful if the Court makes clear that that means that\nyou can look at the jump in addition to the shoot, right? That's the core\nissue that we want to be able to litigate.\nBut, yes, Justice Alito, we'd be happy with a very narrow holding.",

What's\nthe harm to the individual? In this particular case, we're talking about\nunpaid tolls.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nWell, true.\nBut, obviously, you know, traffic stops sometimes identify people who\nare doing things that are much worse.\nOftentimes, major criminals are apprehended for things like that, and I\ncan give you some historical examples that are obvious, but -- so I don't\nknow that an officer can assume that's the only thing going on.\nAnd if someone's pulling away, they could be a danger to others on the\nroad.\nWho knows what's going on, right?\n### Nathaniel A.G.

Zelinsky:\nI think that the -- there are a series of reoccurring fact patterns. I think\nthere are two of them.\nI think that the jumping in front of or onto car does occur with some\nfrequency.\nSo we cited in our reply brief a study of 400 stops that found that there\nis a routine problem of officers jumping in front of cars --in the article,\nit's described \"in a Hollywood style\" -- and then shooting the driver.\nThe other reoccurring fact pattern is a pattern where officers fail to\nidentify themselves, and the suspect, exercising his or her own Second\nAmendment rights to self -defense, pulls out a firearm.\nThe Fifth Circuit alone has two cases in which they apply the moment of\nthe threat doctrine.\nThe cases are Cass and Royal.\nAnd they say: We can't look at the fact that the officer failed to identify\nhimself.\nWe can only look at the fact that the officer faced a loaded gun.\nAnd that, by the way, is just sharply inconsistent with how the common\nlaw approached the exact same circumstance.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nOn the jumping in front of the car, I think you said this earlier, but\nsometimes it'll be reasonable and sometimes not?\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nSo, yeah, let me give you an example maybe where it might be\nreasonable just to help flesh it out. Take the tragic terrorist attack in\nNew Orleans.\nIn that particular case, someone used a car as a weapon of terror.\nIf an officer had jumped in front of the car and shot the driver, that\nofficer would be a hero, and it's because the state interest in that case in\nseizing that terrorist is incredibly high.\nAgain, that's the type of balancing that the Fifth Circuit just couldn't\nengage in in this case.",

Zelinsky:\nBecause you have to look --reasonableness.\nThe framers gave us a test of reasonableness, and that is a --it's a two-\nway street, not a one-way ratchet.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThe common law -- you gave the prime example in the common law,\nwhich is, if an officer -- a plain clothes officer doesn't announce he's an\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nYes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\ndefend themselves and pull out a gun?\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nYes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nYes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo -- okay.\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nAnd then the other response to your question -- and I -- and I have two\nmore answers.\nThe first is that there's just a wealth of Fifth Circuit cases that come out\nin the other direction and are just crystal-clear. So I would just direct the\nCourt to the Harris v. Serpas case, and that's quoted by Judge\nHigginbotham in his decision below.\nIn Harris, the Fifth Circuit goes out of its way to say this Court has\nnarrowed that test, and \"that test\" is referring to the Graham test.\nThey are self-consciously clear that they are narrowing this Court's\nprecedent.\nAnd the court then goes on to say any of the officer's actions leading up\nto the shooting are not relevant for the purposes of an excessive force\ninquiry in this circuit.\nSo that's a categorical bar.\nAnd then the third point is that in this case, you don't just have Judge\nHigginbotham who's describing the split or the -- the moment of the\nthreat doctrine; you also have Judge Elrod and Judge Smith who sign on\nto that panel decision, and all of them agree this is how the doctrine\noperates in the Fifth Circuit.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThank you.",

Jacoby:\nSo, Justice Kavanaugh, we completely agree that the -- the Graham\ninquiry has to be very sensitive and deferential to the officer's need for -\n-for split-second decision-making.\nI think the training, the guidance we would have officers be given is one\nthat officers are already trained under, as Petitioner points out at page\n41 of -- of her brief.\nBasically, you may use force to respond to a danger to yourself or the\npublic, but don't manufacture a situation where the use of force\nbecomes essentially inevitable.\nAnd I think that kind of guidance would be helpful to officers.\nWhen they are in a split-second moment in a traffic stop, as you're\ndiscussing, it may often be reasonable to use force to stop the -- the\nvehicle.\nA vehicle can be a dangerous weapon, as this Court has recognized.\nBut that's not true in every single case, and the Graham inquiry has to be\ncase-sensitive to that also.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nWell, I think the officers are going to want to know do I let him go or do I\nnot let him go as a general proposition when someone pulls away from a\ntraffic stop, or do I try to jump on the car, jump in front of the car.\nAnd I don't know that your --and I realize we're not going to flesh all\nthis out in this case, but officers are presumably paying attention to\nthis, and they have to make those decisions all the time.\nI'm curious, let him go or not?\n### Zoe A. Jacoby:\nOf course.\nI think it's going to depend on what you've pulled them over for: if you\nknow or suspect them to be armed; how they are behaving in your\ninteraction with them; if you're getting the sense that, as they pull\naway, they're going to pose right away a big danger to people on the\nroad.\nAnd Respondent says that that was the case here, and it may well have\nbeen, and it may well have been reasonable to --to use force to stop the\nofficer or to jump on the car to -- to stop Barnes from getting away.\nBut the Fifth Circuit just didn't consider any of that, and that's what we\nthink is wrong.",

Or are you asking the court or the jury\nto determine whether the whole course of conduct in which the officer is\nengaged was unreasonable, in part in the sense that it wasn't prudent, it\nwas in violation of perhaps departmental policies or the best practices\nthat had been established for police department -- that --that some\npeople think should be followed by police departments around the\ncountry? That -- that's really the difficult question, and what -- what\nwould you say to that?\n### Zoe A. Jacoby:\nI would say, Justice Alito, the former.\nThe question is: Was the use of force, the seizure, reasonable in the\nmoment? That's what we're trying to get at when we look at the totality\nof circumstances.\nWe're not doing some sort of freewheeling inquiry into whether the\nofficer overall, over the course of five minutes, acted reasonably.\nSo -- so that is why we think the circumstances in the moment do have\nprime importance.\nBut that does not mean that courts have a license to ignore everything\nbefore that moment, as the Fifth Circuit did here.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, would it be -- would a court hearing this case be obligated to\nadmit expert testimony by various individuals who have a view about\nwhat are good police practices and what are not good police practices?\nWould the -- would that be what the jury's determination would boil\ndown to?\n### Zoe A. Jacoby:\nSo the ultimate determination here about whether the officer acted\nreasonably is, according to Scott, a pure question of law.\nThe jury's not deciding that.\nThe jury could be making factual determinations about what actually\nhappened, you know, when the officer jumped and -- and all the rest.\nAs the Court is examining whether that initial thing that the officer did\nhere, jumping on the car, was outside the bounds of reasonable\nbehavior, I do think it's appropriate to look at training manuals and the\nlike.\nThat can't resolve the question, but that could provide helpful\nguidance.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, there are federal -- there are some federal law enforcement\nofficers who make vehicle stops.\nSo what is the -- the teaching?

McCloud:\nSo I have a couple of responses on that.\nFirst, I don't think that that's the best reading of the panel decision.\nI understand that that's what Judge Higginbotham asserted in his solo\nconcurrence, but that is not the law, and he doesn't get to make the law",

McCloud:\nAnd this Court has consistently said that when an officer confronts a\ngenuine threat, it is not excessive to use force.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nThat's an objective inquiry, though, isn't it?\n### Charles L.

And\nputting aside your -- your record -based concerns, it is a question.\nWe granted cert on it.\nI think everybody agrees it's wrong.\nWhy -- what's the harm of saying that?\n### Lanora C. Pettit:\nAs long as Your Honor is very clear that you are not endorsing the\ncreation of the risk theory adopted by the Ninth and Tenth Circuit, then I\ndon't think there's anything necessarily wrong.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nOkay.\n### Lanora C. Pettit:\nI agree with my colleague that it is unnecessary, and the reason I say that\nthe --sorry, the Fifth Circuit quoted at length a district court opinion\nthat looked at those earlier circumstances.\nSo I don't think it's necessary.\nAs long as the Court is clear that we are not adopting the creation-of-\nthe-risk theory, we have no quarrel with such an action.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nThank you.\n### Lanora C. Pettit:\nGoing to the nature of the questions here for just a minute, I would point\nout that the inquiry here is -- I heard a lot of concerns about line -\ndrawing, and I find that interesting because the Petitioner's argument\nhere was that they just wanted to consider the jump as well as the shoot.\nThat itself is a line-drawing question, and it -- and it's very deliberate\nbecause they have actually litigated whether everything up until the\njump was reasonable, and the district court concluded that it was,\nbecause, again, courts below are not considering just the two seconds.\nInstead, they are considering the totality of the circumstances.\nAnd to the question from the United States about the subjective nature\nof the test, this goes, again, to the arguments that had been raised up\nuntil the --the reply brief, which was after our argument, in which -- or\nour brief, in which the Petitioner was endorsing the view of the Ninth\nand Tenth Circuit, which this Court in Mendez expressly acknowledged\nwas subjective and therefore inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment,\nwhich, again, is why we think this Court, if it is going to remand, which,\nagain, is unnecessary, makes very clear that it is not adopting that view\nbecause it would be a fundamental shift in the Fourth Amendment.\nAnd it also is a shift that, going to",

Zelinsky:\nI have five very brief points.\nFirst, Justice Jackson, you asked my friend on the other side when they\nargued for the test that was applied below.\nListen to minutes 28 and 29 of oral argument.\nThen you'll hear that there.\nJustice Sotomayor, you noted that my friends on the other side agree in\nmany cases that the jump-in-front -of-car case, you need to look at the\nwhole picture of what the officer did, the jump and the shoot.\nIt is -- there is no rule that --they can't distinguish that case from this\ncase.\nThird, Justice Kavanaugh, you had some practical questions about how\nthis is going to impact effective policing.\nOfficers receive qualified immunity.\nAs the Cato brief discusses, 99-plus percent of the time they are also\nindemnified by the municipality.\nYou have a brief of 22 former high-ranking police chiefs who are in front\nof you saying that you should rule for Petitioner and it will not hamper\nbut promote good policing.\nAnd then, third, the DHS rule is a great example of why this is not going\nto harm effective policing.\nFourth, Justice Alito, I want to be very clear, we are not saying that every\nsingle mistake is going to result in liability.\nWhat we are saying is you have to look at the whole picture, and, here,\nthat's more than ju st two seconds.\nFinally, Justice Gorsuch, we agree wholeheartedly this rule is\ninconsistent with the common law.\nIf you rule and adopt the moment of the threat doctrine, you will\nessentially enact a hereto unprecedented rule permitting the killing of\nfleeing misdemeanants. You should not do that.\nYou should vacate and remand.\nThank you.",
