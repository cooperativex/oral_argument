  "background": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe'll hear argument next in Case 23-1324, Perttu versus Richards.\nMs. Sherman.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Exhaustion is the\ncenterpiece of Congress's reforms under the Prison Litigation Reform\nAct.\nYet, even with this invigorated exhaustion requirement, prisoner\nlawsuits still account for an outsize share of filings in federal district\ncourts.\nA rule that requires a jury trial on intertwined exhaustion issues would\nincrease this burden while incentivizing non-exhaustion and\nundermining the goals and structure of the PLRA.\nRespondent would have this Court cast aside the PLRA's goals and\nstructure merely because exhaustion is an affirmative defense. Focusing\non this Court's holding in Jones versus Bock, he contends that there's no\nprincipled reason for treating PLRA exhaustion differently than other\naffirmative defenses that are routinely sent to juries when there are\nfacts intertwined with the merits.\nJones does not stand for this broad proposition.\nIt held only that prisoners need not plead exhaustion.\nAnd there is a principled reason for treating PLRA exhaustion differently\nthan other affirmative defenses.\nIt is a mandatory prerequisite to suit.\nSo its intended benefits would be entirely undercut by merits discovery\nand a trial before its resolution.\nPLRXA -- PLRA exhaustion must be resolved by a judge at the early\nstages of litigation.\nContrary to the Sixth Circuit, this does not run afoul of the Seventh\nAmendment even when there are intertwined facts.\nThe judge's determination on exhaustion does not interfere with the\njury's ultimate fact-finding role because dismissal is typically without\nprejudice and the judge's determination on exhaustion would not have\npreclusive effect.\nRichards, like many other prisoners, can exhaust, come back, and have a\njury decide the merits of any viable claims.\nFor this reason, this Court should reverse the Sixth Circuit's decision.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Sherman:\nI don't think there's anything that changes the nature of exhaustion. I\nthink what it does is it -- it -- it makes one have to consider the Seventh\nAmendment now. If -- if there are intertwined facts, is that an\nimplication of the Seventh Amendment?

Sherman:\nI don't think the Court has to rule on that.\nI think it's a question that is naturally embedded in the question\npresented.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI understand, but if I assume it, okay, so fine, aren't we still faced with\nthe question that you present, as a matter of your question presented, is\nthen we have intertwinement of a claim that does not get a jury, the\nexhaustion claim, with a claim that does? Do you concede that the First\nAmendment retaliation claim is one that would ordinarily go to the jury?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nWhen -- when the right to a jury trial accrues and exhaustion has been\nmet, I agree that that is a claim that should go to the jury.\nAnd this Court has been very clear that 1983 claims are entitled to a jury\ntrial.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAll right.\nSo we do have the intertwinement.\nAt least you concede it in your brief.\nAnd so why wouldn't the sort of standard Beacon Theatres view of how\nwe deal with that situation apply here?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nBeacon Theatres doesn't apply here for a number of reasons.\nOne, Beacon Theatres was driven by a concern for collateral estoppel.\nWould there -- would there be a preclusive effect that would completely\ncut off any right to have the -- the --the jury trial on the merits?\n### Justice Jackson:\nI don't see that in the opinion.\nI mean, I see that it talks about preclusive effect, but that didn't\nnecessarily seem to me to be driving the analysis.\nAnd -- and we've had a lot of cases that have applied this sort of\nintertwinement principle in which preclusion really hasn't been the\nmain focus.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nI think Beacon Theatres itself talked about preclusion, preclusive effect,\nand that being a concern.\nAnd later on, this Court in Parklane Hosiery said, when we looked at\nBeacon Theatres, which, again, this Court has said is -- collateral\nestoppel is only a flexible, judge-made doctrine, and -- and this Court\n### Justice Jackson:\nAll right.\nSo why isn't that a case here? I mean, what --what law do we have that\nsays that an exhaustion determination by a judge in this situation that\nrequires them to find all the facts about whether or not there was actual\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nWell, what we have here is the flexible doctrine of collateral estoppel\nand what we know about collateral estoppel and why it's applied and\nwhy it doesn't get applied. And one of the big issues here is that you\ndon't -- this Court has said over and over in cases, and so have the lower\ncourts, that collateral estoppel is applied -- is not applied when the\nlitigants have not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate.\nAnd when a litigant is litigating -- on either side is litigating\nexhaustion, they have not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate on\nthe merits even if there are overlapping factors.",

If we announced the rule\nthat you want us to announce, which is exhaustion never goes to a jury,\nin the mine-run of cases that are not rape-related, prisoners are\nprecluded, practically speaking.\nWe have an amicus brief that says that most exhaustion requirements\nare --half of them, half the states, are 15 days or less.\nAnd in the others, they are matters of days more than that but no more\nthan 30.\nMost of the time, when you file a suit as a prisoner, it takes --the answer\ntakes 30 days.\nSo most cases as a practical matter would be precluded if we adopt your\nrule that exhaustion under all circumstances is not preclusive.\n### Ann M.

That depends on you, meaning the prison.\nWhy would a prison ever do it? Are you aware of any prison that says you\nfailed to exhaust, but now you can come back?\n### Ann M.

Sherman:\nI think it is in the best interest of the prison systems to try to work out\nproblems.\nAnd one of the things that our amicus, multi-state amicus brief, led by\nOhio, has pointed out is that under Mr. Richards's rule, if this Court\nadopts it, there are going to be very few prison systems that want to\nallow for any excusal of untimeliness.\nThat's going to be a disincentive for them to do that because they've\nalready gone through a jury trial.\nNow why are they going to excuse untimeliness? But, if they -- a\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nHuh?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI --I -- I'm a little lost.\nThey've gone through a jury trial.\nThey won.\nAnd the prison is going to listen to the complaint again?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy would they bother?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy would the state bother having -- want to?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhat incentive does it need to?\n### Ann M.

You don't dispute that?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nI don't dispute that.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nYeah.\nAll right. And, here, we have an individual who brought such a claim, and\ninstead of a -- and demanded a jury of his peers and, instead, he got a\nmagistrate judge over Zoom.\n### Ann M.

Sherman:\nThank you.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nMs. McGill.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I just wanted\nto begin with two clarifying points.\nThis is the first time in this five years of litigation that the State has\nrepresented that the --all of the claims might be able to be exhausted.\nThe First Amendment claim that was the subject of the Sixth Circuit's\ndecision here, as far as we can tell, is not protected by the PREA policy.\nAnd the Sixth Circuit held that exhaustion and the merits here were\ncompletely coterminous under Sixth Circuit First Amendment law.\nThe State also agrees that the historical facts at issue here are of the\ntype that juries decide, and I think that makes this an easy case on the\nactual question presented because, whatever else is true, this is a 1983\naction for money damages.\nSo the jury must resolve those facts regardless of how you characterize\nexhaustion.\nThat is the point of Beacon Theatres, which is just a specific application\nof the general rule that even truly threshold issues must be deferred to\nthe jury when they're intertwined with the merits.\nIt's no answer to say that the facts could be relitigated in front of a jury\nmaybe if and only if the case proceeds.\nIt's simply not good enough that the jury trial right might sometimes be\npreserved.\nAnd the State's suggestion that judicial findings would not be binding\non a future hypothetical fact-finder really gives the game away.\nThe only reason that would be so is because of the Seventh Amendment.\nThat was this Court's unanimous holding in Lytle.\nAnd there's certainly nothing in the statute or the federal rules that\nwould suggest the non-binding factual findings procedure that the\nState suggests here.\nThe State warns that having jury trials on exhaustion will undermine the\ngoals of the PLRA.\nThose very same arguments were presented and rejected in Jones, and\nthey're even less persuasive here.\nThe State's approach would not reduce the number of trials required.\nWe're talking about the cases that have survived judicial screening and\nRule 56, the needles in the haystack as it were.\nRegardless, policy arguments are no match for the Bill of Rights.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Barrett\n### Justice Barrett:\nCounsel, can I ask you a question? This is a methodological one.\nIn some ways, this case presents the problem that we've seen in the\nSecond Amendment context because this is a history and tradition test,\nbut it's one that goes all the way back to Justice Story in, like, 1812,\nright? And, you know, in other cases, we've been able to draw analogs\nbased on the cause of action.\nAnd I think that's a more or less stable line when you're trying to find a\nhistorical analog, is this more like a common law or an equitable\nquestion.\nThis defense thing is a lot harder, right, especially since there was no\nreally good analog at the time of the founding.\nSo I think what we have now is Congress coming up with something new\nand then how do -- what do we do in the face of historical uncertainty.\nAnd, you know, functional considerations may guide, but I guess what\nI'm trying to figure out --and this is really just a question -- I mean, it's\ntrue, as you say, that one set of circumstances we could look at in\nmaking a judgment about whether this goes to a jury or has to go to a\njury if he invokes the Seventh Amendment right is the factual nature of\nAnother one, though, is does Congress have some room here to create\nnew defenses that are functioning more as equitable, like these\nthreshold questions.\nAnd it seems to me l ike in Wetmore, the Court did, even though\njurisdiction was a jury issue in the beginning, did kind of back off a little\nbit and said: Well, you know, a judge has discretion to go one way or\nanother based on the 1875 Act that didn't lock in the form of pleading.\nSo, I mean, I -- I guess my question is: In the face of historical\nuncertainty, how do we weigh what Congress has to say about threshold\nconsiderations? Because it is clear that in the PLRA, exhaustion was\ndesigned to try to weed out suits.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nOkay.\n### Justice Barrett:\nI'm not saying that that's determi native.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nRight.\n### Justice Barrett:\nI'm just trying to figure out how to think about it.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nI think I understand the question.\nI mean, I think most of your question is sort of answered by the detailed\nanalysis of the majority opinion and Justice Scalia's concurring opinion,\nwhich the majority said that they agreed with in full in Del Monte Dunes.\nAnd, there, I mean, history certainly was the guide and -- and provided\nthe analog, which was a common law, you know, tort claim for damages,\nwas the historical analog that allowed the Court to say: No question that\na 1983 action for damages is an action at law.\nAnd so the question is, you know, how -- what work does the history do\non the specific issue question, and I think the Court resolved that by\nsimply saying: Where we don't have a guide, we look to precedent and\nthen, you know, functional considerations.\nAnd the Court described those functional considerations as preserving\nthe -- the jury's historic role as the trier of fact. So I think it's sort of a\nwell -worn path. And the -- the only thing I would add is that this Court\nlast term in Jarkesy pointed out that Congress can't sort of take an\naction at law and morph it into something else by tweaking its elements\nor adding something or narrowing it in some respect and then just\nsaying: Hey, this isn't actually the common law cause of action\nanymore.\n### Justice Barrett:\nYeah.\nBut, in Jarkesy -- I agree, but in Jarkesy, we drew an analogy to fraud and\nsaid, like, this is fraud, it's analogous to frog and -- fraud, not frog, sorry\nAnd, here, the problem is we don't have that same line.\nAnd I'm not saying that -- I'm not saying that you lose.\nI'm just saying we haven't had a case quite like this where we had to\nmake that methodological choice, which does make it a bit different.\nAnd I think Wetmore does complicate the question --the issue a little\nbit for you.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nSo I think, if you --if you wanted to take a slightly more circuitous route\nthan what Justice Scalia and the majority did in Del Monte Dunes, what\nyou would say is: We have this action at law.\nThere's no specific analog.\nBut you could still look to history to see, for example, well, what are the\ntypes of -- you know, would a jury have --have gotten to decide factual\nissues with respect to an affirmative defense in this type of tort action\nand common law.\nWe think that historical answer is very clear.\nSo, even though there wasn't an affirmative defense called\n\"exhaustion\" in 1791, there were affirmative defenses to tort liability\ndamages, including the statute of limitations.\nAnd we know that juries decided factual disputes with regard to an\naffirmative defense.",

So that has never been\nconsidered to be a jury issue.\nNow there is a right to a jury trial on a Title VII claim.\nCongress has -- has extended it, but there's an --an argument,\ncommentators have made the argument, that the Seventh Amendment\nwould also cover that because a claim for unlawful termination would\nhave some 1791 analog. So what about that?\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nIf I understand the question correctly, you're asking about exhaustion in\n### Justice Alito:\nYeah.\n### Justice Alito:\nYeah.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nI mean, Judge Posner, four years after Pavey, wrote a decision saying\nexactly that, that because Title VII exhaustion is very similar to the\nstatute of limitations and is an affirmative defense, there's no basis in\nthe statute or history to treat it differently than another affirmative\ndefense for Seventh Amendment purposes.\nSo, actually, the -- at least the Seventh Circuit and several other circuit\ndecisions that we cite in our brief have treated that as a jury trial issue\nregardless of -- of overlap with the merits.",
