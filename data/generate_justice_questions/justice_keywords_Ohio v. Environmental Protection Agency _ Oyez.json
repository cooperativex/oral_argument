Sridharan:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The EPA set out to address\nthe contributions of 23 upwind states to downwind air pollution\nthrough a single federal plan, but, as commenters predicted and before\nthe plan became final, the legal predicates for the federal plan, that is,\nthe state plan disapprovals, came under fire in courts all around the\ncountry. The specter of lesser participation in the federal plan revealed\nyet another problem. The EPA's choice of method, that is, selecting a\nsingle cost threshold and applying it uniformly across all 23 states to\nestablish emissions limits, has consequences; namely, the math doesn't\nwork when the inputs don't match the outputs. With the SIP\ndisapprovals in flux and the EPA's methodology requiring full\nparticipation, the EPA had an obligation to consider what happens to the\nfederal plan when one or more states drop out, that is, when the inputs,\n23 states, don't match the outputs, now the 11 states that remain in the\nplan. Its failure has become consequential. The plan now regulates\nunder half of the states and a quarter of the emissions that the EPA\noriginally set out to regulate. Under this fractured plan and without a\nstay, the remaining states and their industries face serious harm. I\nwelcome the Court's questions.",

Sridharan:\nThe best evidence for that, Your Honor, is the method that the EPA\nchose, and the method it chose has to do with discerning points of\ndiminishing marginal returns, which means that when the mix of states\nchanges, in this case, when states drop out and their particular\ntechnologies and industries drop out with them, those points of\ndiminishing marginal returns shift, and they shift somewhat\nunpredictably, which means that the relevant cost threshold for a\ndifferent mix of states could be cheaper, and, with full candor to the\nCourt, it could be the same or even be more expensive. The problem is\nwe don't know. It is the unpredictability that renders this plan\nunreasonable as to any different mix of states.",

No court has looked at the kinds\nof questions that you're raising here and the kinds of questions that we\nasked you to discuss. Not a single court has addressed that issue.

Sridharan:\nWell, two reasons or two answers to that, Your Honor. First of all, while\nthese proceedings are going on, the states and their industries continue\nto suffer irreparable harm.

With respect to the Clean Air Act itself,\nit ties publication in the Federal Register to final agency action that is\nreviewable under the Clean Air Act's judicial review provisions. Second,\nby the EPA's own words in the prepublication notice it presented in\nMarch, the EPA noted that that would not be the final rule for the\npurpose of compliance, and, in fact, that would fail the second prong of\nthis Court's Bennett test because legal consequences did not flow from\nthat. But I also want to take a step back because, even if this Court\ndisagrees with me as to whether the stays fall into or out of the gambit\nof what the agency had to consider, the fact that the commenters\npreviewed all of the problems with respect to the SIP disapprovals and\ncautioned that the federal plan's uniformity would -- would falter, and\nthen very quickly afterwards there was confirmation of that through\nthe federal plan was in a prepublication form.

And one of the reasons usually we\ndon't take cert on a case is if it has a lot of stuff before you get to the\nmerits issues, which is the only thing that we would be concerned about.\nAnd it --it does seem to me you want to -- the term \"stuff,\" sometimes\nreferred to as vehicle issues, there are just a lot of them here, right?\nThere's the question of did you have to comment and did you\ncomment? Then there's the question of, well, even if you couldn't\ncomment but --because you didn't know enough, should you have filed\na motion for reconsideration? And you didn't file a motion for\nreconsideration. Then there's this very complex issue about how your\nquestion relates to the validity of the SIP disapprovals themselves\nbecause, if the SIP disapprovals were valid, you wouldn't have a leg to\nstand on here. So how are we supposed to know that in this posture? So I\nguess what I'm saying is there are so many hoops that you have to go\nthrough and you have to go through all of them. You have to run the\ntable before we could even begin to get to your merits question. Isn't\nthat, according to our usual standards, a reason to deny this\napplication?\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nJustice Kagan, you've given a lot of stuff associated with this case, but\nthere's one thing I really want to talk about, which is what happens if\nthe SIP disapprovals ultimately settle in a place where all 23 states end\nup staying in the plan. That doesn't change our argument. The problem\nis the EPA failed to consider in the first instance what happens when\nthere is lesser participation. This is something that it doesn't matter\nwhat's going to happen next.\n### Justice Kagan:\nWell, that's sort of interesting. That doesn't seem intuitive to me. I\nmean, if all these lawsuits that the states are bringing are going to end\nup losing, I mean, the idea that you can be here and be demanding\nemergency relief just because states have kicked up a lot of dust seems\nnot the right answer to me.\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nNo, that's not right, Your Honor, be cause, in this very unusual\ncircumstance under the statute, as well as the EPA's choice of method, it\nis relevant to look back at what Your Honor has just termed \"kicking up\ndust.\" But it's not kicking up dust because, first of all, the legal flaws\nwere quite obvious, and they were previewed by commenters, and then\nvery shortly afterwards litigation and then the stays came around, all of\nwhich the EPA had an obligation to engage in rulemaking with its eyes\nwide open. Now, why that matters, I gave you two reasons: the unique\nstatutory circumstance, as well as the EPA's choice of method. The\nstatute itself requires the EPA to look back to prior predicate rulemaking\nin order to assert its authority to have a federal plan, and necessarily\nbaked into that is the fact that there may be judicial intervention,\nespecially by the EPA's own doing.\n### Justice Kagan:\nWhat do you think the EPA should have done? I mean, there are 23 states\nhere.\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nMm- hmm.\n### Justice Kagan:\nWas the EPA required to sort of consider every permutation, you know, if\n22 states are in the plan, if 21 states are in the plan, if 13 states are in the\nplan, if five states are in the plan? Which states are they? One of my\nclerks who does math better than I do tells me that there are two to the\n23rd power, which is like 4 million different permutations. What was the\nEPA supposed to do?\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nWell, I'm not going to go as far as to say that the EPA had to do\nnecessarily every possible permutation of two to the power of 23 minus\n### Justice Kagan:\nUgh.\n(Laughter.)\n### Justice Kagan:\nI have to tell my clerk it's minus one. (Laughter.)\n### Mathura J. Sridharan:\nis acknowledge the problem. So we're very far from talking abou t the\nline-drawing things that you're talking about. What the EPA had to do\nwas consider whether, under this method, it would need to address\ncontingencies. And we're familiar in other areas of law where --for\nexample, in elections law, where you run a number of simulations and\ndecide, you know what, we have a critical mass of a particular solution.\nLet's apply that. Let's go ahead with that.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.",

Stetson:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: EPA's authority under the\nGood Neighbor provision is limited to regulating a state's emissions\nthat contribute significantly to downwind non- attainment. If EPA is\nregulating beyond that authority, it is regulating beyond the statute.\nMs. Sridharan has explained the deficiencies in a broken rule in which 90\npercent of power plant emissions, 75 percent of total emissions, have\nbeen taken out of the plan. But the Court also asked whether the\nemissions controls in the rule are reasonable regardless of the number\nof states that are involved. The answer is no for three primary reasons.\nFirst, the rule selectively ignores EME Homer's cost -effectiveness\nframework. Second, the rule over- controls across a number of\nindustries. And, third, the rule imposes an impossible compliance\ntimeline that will result in reliability issues across the country. I\nwelcome the Court's questions.",

So let me ask it in a different way. Could\nEPA have accomplished the exact same thing by reg ulating the states\nindividually as opposed to in a --as a interdependent group?\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nIt could not have accomplished the exact same thing,\n### Justice Thomas:\n, to\nthe extent that it would have to show, when you say \"exact same\nthing,\" that the outcome, the cost threshold and so forth, would be the\nsame across 11 states. But, to your question of Ms. Sridharan, I think the\nissue that you were looking for is evidence about what EPA did, and I\nwant to point you to 88 Federal Register 36741. Excuse me. \"When the\neffects of\" -- I'm quoting. \"When the effects of these emissions\nreductions are assessed collectively across the hundreds of EGU and\nnon- EGU industrial sources that are subject to this rule, the cumulative\nimprovements in ozone levels at downwind receptors, while they may\nvary to some extent, are both measurable and meaningful.\" That is the\nbest example of the collective question that EPA asked itself and\nanswered. Now, you know, Justice Sotoma yor, you asked the question\nabout cost and whether the obligations, for example, in Ohio would be\nthe same. But I think the question here is -- goes back to what this\nCourt approved in EME Homer. It's not just a question about whether\nEPA can regulate something that is inexpensive, potentially\ninexpensive. It's not a question about whether EPA can regulate\nemissions. It's a question about whether EPA has appropriately\ncalculated what it calls that knee in the curve, the point where the\nemissions contribution to a downwind state is controlled at a\nreasonable cost level. So I think the exchange that you had with Ms.\nSridharan about where that cost issue comes from has to do with the\nquestion about, if you've got 23 states and all of their EGUs and all of the\nnon -EGU sources that are linked into this rule all feeding into that cost\nquestion, what happens if you take out the states where maybe you can\ncontrol those costs most cheaply and you're left with states th at\nactually have much higher cost thresholds to impose on industries or on\nEGUs? That changes the cost calculus. It also changes, of course, the",

Stetson:\nWhen -- when we discuss the 23 -state question. You can look at pages\n11 to 13 of the Kinder Morgan brief. You can look at pages 18 to 20 and 4\nto 9 of the reply. And all of those go to this question about that\ndifference between 23 and 11. But I want to bring home the point with a\n### Justice Kagan:\nI guess -- I guess my reaction is a little bit the same as -- that I -- I gave\nto Ms. Sridharan, is, I mean, this is at such a higher level of generality\nthan you're making the same argument now. You know, our briefs do\nnot really address this very complicated cost argument.\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nI think, Justice Kagan, the --the cost argument, while --while some of\nthe metrics, I think, are complicated, things like ozone modeling and so\nforth, the -- the bottom line is actually not that complicated. The\nbottom line is what EPA was supposed to do under the Good Neighbor\nprovision was to figure out, as it said in EME Homer and as it said it was\ndoing here, where is that cost threshold. That word, \"cost threshold,\" if\nyou go back and look at the rule in EME Homer, appears 185 times. But\nwhat the Court did -- what -- what the EPA did here with respect to\nnon- EGUs in particular is to look at the question about average costs,\nwhich is a completely different issue. Average cost is just how much do\nthese emissions control cost? Does that seem like a reasonable number?\nOkay, we'll apply them and see what emissions controls exist\n### Justice Kagan:\nI mean, the only point I was making --and I don't want to push you too\nhard on this because it's not your fault this is coming in a weird posture.\nI -- I don't even seem the term \"cost threshold\" on these pages.\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nI think the term \"cost threshold\" is -- is in the EPA's brief. It's a\nfundamental question about the way that EME Homer exists. If you look\nat the Kinder Morgan brief, there's a separate discussion of costs that I\nthink is particularly relevant to this. There are two different strands, I\nthink, that we're chasing here. One of them has to do with the 23 versus\n11 question, what happens when you take 12 states out. The other\nquestion has to do with how EPA went about calculating costs.

Stetson:\nYes. And, in fact, if you look at that page that I just cited, 36693, what\nyou'll see is it says, \"Should any jurisdiction- specific aspect of this rule\nbe found invalid, the EPA views the rule as severable. Should any\nindustry- specific rule be found invalid, the EPA rolls this rule -- views\nthis rule as severable.\" This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI'm sorry, whose burden -- that may be their burden below. But the\nburden here as I understand it is on you to show this. And we go back to\nwhat Justice Kagan said. I read the -- I read these applications pretty\ncarefully, and I didn't understand this cost argument at all. And I'm\nreally simplistic. I don't have a math degree, all right? If you're sharing\ncosts among 23 people, your cost is going to be less. If you' re sharing\ncosts among 11 people, your cost is going to be more. So, since this plan\ndoesn't change any allocations depending on the number of people who\nare in it, states are bound by the number that was calculated on the\nlarger group, how are the remaining states affected by the fact that\ntheir cost should have been higher, but it's not because it's been fixed at\nthis lower number?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI'm very simplistic. You know, cost divided by 23 is always less than cost\ndivided by 11 if your cost is going to stay constant.\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nThat's the question, though. And -- and I think,\n### Justice Sotomayor:\n, the\nBut does it matter? Meaning, if you're paying less on the wrong number\nbecause it was divided by 23, how could it be that on 11 your cost is ever\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nJustice Sotomayor, I -- I think so much of it has to do with the states\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nNo. My point is, once the states drop out, it doesn't matter what your\nresponsibility is because the cost is going to remain the same given the\nnature of this plan. They're not changing the cost once they've\ncalculated the responsibility of the 23.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nIf 12 are not paying it, what does it matter to you?\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nwas calculated where it was because EPA looked at the aggregate costs\nof controls over that --that Federal Register cite that I read you,\nhundreds of EGUs across all of the states, hundreds of industries' units\nacross all of the states. It figured out what that aggregate cost was and\nthen it decided to allocate obligations. So we keep talking about the end\nof that process, what --what obligations would change on a state based\non taking some states out.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nIt seems to me that if the aggregate is contributing to something and\nthere's a certain amount of people who for whatever legal reason have\nbeen taken out of the calculus, why should you pay for them or not pay\nfor them if the problem is a national one really, not an individual one?\n### Catherine E. Stetson:\nI think, Justice Sotomayor, that that's actually EPA's argument, is that,\nyou know, it -- it makes sense to impose these emissions controls\nacross these industries because it will result in what EPA calls\nmeaningful reductions. Now I'd encourage you to look at page 36743\nand 36747 to figure out exactly the scope of those meaningful\nreductions of the '88 Federal Register final rule. What we're talking\nabout when it comes to meaningful reductions is on the order of a total\nof .66 parts per billion averaged across all of these receptors. Now\nthere's a bigger number involved. That number is, if you add all of the\nreductions from the receptors from Arizona to Connecticut and you add\nthem up, then you get a bigger parts per billion number, but that's like\nticketing me for speeding if I exceed the speed limit one mile per hour in",

Stewart:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to\nmake three quick points at the outset.\nFirst, with respect to the interests of the state applicants, I think it's\nimportant to bear in mind that at this stage of the proceedings, there\nare a lot more states on our side than there are on theirs, and it's vital to\nbear in mind the equities of the downwind states because that's the\nwhole point of the Good Neighbor provision of the Clean Air Act and the\n\"Good Neighbor Plan\" that the EPA implemented.\nAnd when we think about the interests of the downwind states, it's\nnatural to think first of their humanitarian interest in the health and\nwell-being of their residents. But the downwind states that are out of\nattainment also have a legal obligation to come into attainment by\ndeadlines specified by the statute.\nAnd to stay the rule in its entirety based on some theoretical possibility\nthat the contours of an 11-state rule might have been somewhat\ndifferent if EPA had anticipated all the stays would be terribly unfair to\nthe downwind states.\nThe second point is that in addition to the severability language that\nJustice Kavanaugh refe rred to, EPA in the preamble said that it was\nreserving judgment on whether several additional states should\nultimately be included in the plan.\nIt said that if any of the 23 states that were currently included devised\ncompliant SIPs, they could be taken out of the federal plan.\nAnd so EPA anticipated from the outset that the plan was one whose\ngeographic composition could change.\nAnd EPA devised the requirements for each state in order that they\nwould be workable if a smaller or a larger set of states were ultimately\ncovered.\nAnd then the last thing I would say is it's true that the federal plan is not\ncurrently providing the air quality benefits that EPA had hoped because\nthe stays of the SIP plan disapprovals mean it's only reducing emissions\nfrom 11 states rather than 23.\nBut, for those 11 states, the requirements that are imposed on sources\nare exactly the same as would have been imposed on sources in those 11\nstates if the full plan had been implemented.\nAnd the -- the applicants have suggested that it's -- it's possible that\nthe benefits associated with those requirements might have been\ndifferent if EPA had known that only 11 states would have been included.\nBut there's no reason to think that that's so.\nAs we look at it, the difference between three and zero is the same as the\ndifference between 10 and seven.\nthe 11 states are only delivering 30 percent of the benefits, they're still\ndelivering that -- that same quantum of air quality benefit.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Stewart:\nI think part of the reason that we won't look -- look at it is that the\nground is still shifting; that is, EPA earlier in the year proposed to\ndisapprove the -- the plans of several additional states, which, if that\nultimately went forward as the -- the final decision, would result in the\naddition of those states to the plan.\nWe had a ruling from the Tenth Circuit at the end of the day on Friday\nsaying that that proceeding is being transferred to the D.C.

There is no deadline.\nThere is a mechanism for arguing that EPA has unreasonably been --has\nunreasonably delayed, but that hasn't been invoked.\n### Justice Alito:\nOkay.\nThe other question has to do with the fact that this is an emergency\napplication.\nWe now receive many applications for stays.\nSometimes your office seeks a stay.\nSometimes your office opposes a stay.\nWhat is your office's position on the question whether in this context\nwhat the stay applicant must show is some sort of super-irreparable\nharm?

Stewart:\nWe would agree with that.\nAnd we would just add the point that this is not just a case where the\nother side needs to make an extraordinary showing.\nIt is a case where, if a stay is entered and the government ultimately\nprevails on the merits, we in the downwind states will suffer a very high,\nhigh degree of continuing harm even after the stay is vacated.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThank you.",

Vale:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the Good Neighbor\nprovision, Congress protected downwind states from pollution emitted\nin upwind states.\nA stay of the Good Neighbor rule would undermine that statutory goal\nand the public interest by sending ozone pollution into downwind\nstates, including Connecticut, Wisconsin, and New York, that receive\nsubstantial pollution from the particular upwind states that are\ncurrently in the rule, including Ohio and Indiana.\nThe harms from a stay will flow to both the residents of downwind\nstates, who will experience health dangers, and to downwind industry,\nwhich pays increased costs to compensate for upwind pollution and\ncomply with the current, more stringent standard.\nFor example, Connecticut sources currently pay up to $13,000 per ton of\nozone precursor reduced while, in the near term for power plants under\nthis rule, just to turn on controls costs about $1,600 per ton.\nBy contrast, apply -- and that's why applying the rule to the upwind\nstates is relatively less expensive and harmful.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Thomas\n### Justice Thomas:\nHow do you arrive at that conclusion that it's less expensive for the\nupwind states?\n### Judith N. Vale:\nIt comes from, I think, two things, one on either side of the balance.\nFor the upwind states, the rule is designed -- the way it -- it defines\n\"significant contribution\" is for sources to do the relatively less\nexpensive controls. I understand that there are still costs, but they are\nrelatively less expensive because it's based on having upwind states do\ncontrols that downwind sources and many other sources across the\ncountry have already done, for example, like turning on pollution\ncontrols on power plants that are already installed.\nThat's the lowest of the low-hanging fruit. By contrast, downwind\nsources, as they get the upwind pollution, they have to compensate for\nit, but they've already exhausted a lot of the less expensive strategies,\nso they need to turn to more and more expensive strategies to find any\nfurther cuts.\nAnd one of the reasons why sources have exhausted their less expensive\noptions is because of the statutory consequences of non-attainment.\nSo, in Section 7511, I believe (a), little (a), it is the Clean Air Act that puts\non more and more stringent requirements onto downwind sources as\nstates move into worse and worse levels of non-attainment.\nSo more and more sources need to put on controls, smaller and smaller\nsources need to put on controls, and the controls themselves get more\nstringent. By -- and -- and -- and I think that that's how we get into\nthis situation for the downwind sources.\nAnd the rule right now continues to provide substantial and meaningful\nbenefits to the downwind sources.\nIt is not a shell or a disaster.\nAnd that's because upwind pollution is not evenly distributed as it goes\ndownwind.\nSo the downwind states that generally get a lot of pollution from the 11\nstates in the rule now still stand to get a lot of benefits.\nSo, for example, in Wisconsin, the areas that struggle with air quality get\napproximately 40 percent of their ozone from the 11 states currently in\nthe rule, 13 percent from Indiana alone.\nAnd for Connecticut, the current scope of the rule gets it 65 percent of\nthe emission reductions compared to the full scope of the rule.\nAnd that relief for downwind states is also urgent because of the way\nnon-attainment works.\nNon-attainment -- those deadlines keep on coming regardless of\nwhether Good Neighbor obligations are fulfilled, even though the\ndeadlines, as the D.C. Circuit has made clear, are supposed to be aligned.",
