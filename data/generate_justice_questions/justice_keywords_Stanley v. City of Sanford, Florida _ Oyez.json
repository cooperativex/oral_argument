  "background": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe'll hear argument next in Case 23-997, Stanley versus the City of\nSanford.\nMr. Gupta.\n### Deepak Gupta:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The ADA permits former\nemployees in Lieutenant Stanley's shoes to challenge discrimination in\npost -employment benefits. There are at least two paths to that\nconclusion here.\nFirst, the narrow path is to recognize that former employees may sue\nwhen they allege that they were discriminated against as qualified\nindividuals while still employed. After she was diagnosed with\nParkinson's in 2016 and before she retired as a firefighter in 2018,\nLieutenant Stanley was indisputably a q ualified individual.\nDuring that period, she was subject to a policy that she alleges reduced\nher compensation in a discriminatory manner.\nUnder the ADA, former employees may challenge such discrimination\neven if they are no longer employed by the time they bring suit.\nIf the Court adopts this rationale, it should make clear that it is not\nforeclosing the possibility that an employee may also challenge\ndiscrimination that, unlike here, occurs entirely after their last day on\nthe job.\nSecond, if the Court chooses to resolve this case on a broader rationale,\nit should hold that former employees may challenge post-employment\ndiscrimination.\nRead in context, as the City rightly concedes it must be, the \"qualified\nindividual\" definition ensures that employers can make necessary job-\nrelated decisions, but it doesn't license discrimination unrelated to job\nperformance or impose a temporal limitation on the ADA's protections.\nCongress made a choice to prohibit discrimination in post -employment\nbenefits, benefits that are crucial to recruiting people to take on\ndangerous jobs like firefighting and policing.\nYet, under the City's reading, the ADA's protections for these benefits\nmean the least precisely when they matter most.\nCongress did not enact such a self-defeating scheme. I welcome the\nCourt's questions.",

The\nEleventh Circuit, erroneous in our -- erroneously in our view, believed\nthat the argument hadn't been properly presented because it appeared\nin an amicus brief by the United States.\nBut that brief by the United States was filed two days before Lieutenant\nStanley filed her opening brief, and her opening brief fully incorporated\nthat argument.\nIn fact, the first page of the brief was a statement of adoption, adoption\nAnd then Lieutenant Stanley referred to that in her summary of\nargument and argument. And it was a focus of the oral argument below.\n### Justice Thomas:\nDo courts normally adopt the -- the positions of amicus to fill in gaps in\nthe parties' briefs?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nNo, I think -- well, I think in the lower courts at least.\nAs we just saw in this Court, sometimes an amicus does play that role.\nBut, in the lower courts, conventionally, no.\nThe Eleventh Circuit was applying a rule that simply because something\nis presented as --in an amicus brie f doesn't mean the court has to reach\nBut this is a different scenario, as I just described, because the amicus\nbrief was filed first, the position was fully adopted in the opening brief,\nand it was discussed at oral argument.\nSo I think, under this Court's formulation of pressed or passed below, it\nwas pressed and it is available to this Court to reissue.\n### Justice Thomas:\nWhen you sought cert here, did you make that argument, or did you\nsimply point out the split between the circuits as to whether former\nemployees can bring an action under the ADA?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nYour Honor, this issue was ventilated in the cert papers.\nI think, if you look at the brief in opposition at page 30 through 31,\nthere's an extensive discussion of this.\nWe discussed it at pages 24 through 25 of the petition and also in the\ncertiorari reply at page 9.\nSo I think we understood the Court in granti ng the case to be -- to be\ngranting the case including that argument.\nAnd it is an answer to the question presented that would resolve at least\npart of the circuit split below.",

And I think they\nare.\n### Justice Jackson:\nWhat are those ingredients?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nI'd first point you to paragraph 16 of the complaint, and there,\nLieutenant Stanley alleged that there came a point where she had no\nchoice but to retire while she was employed by the City of Sanford and\nshe was subject to the policy -- that's also at paragraph 26 -- she was\nsubject to this policy.\nAnd so the factual ingredients for the argument are there.\nShe was -- she was employed by the City.\nShe was able to do her job, but she recognized that she was inevitably\ngoing to have to retire because of a disability that had arose.\nAnd so all of those factual ingredients for the argument we're\npresenting here were there.\nThe argument is where --at least where, as here, someone is employed\nand is a qualified individual indisputably and they are subject to a policy\nthat affects their compensation and that they allege -- allege\ndiminishes their compensation, they are discriminated against.\nAnd that's not new.\nIn fact, the ADA was mapping onto an understanding from Title VII\nwhere suits like that had been brought by employees who were current\nemployees who were suing with respect to post -employment benefits.\nThere were several cases that reached this Court involving sex\nclassifications.\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo you're saying it's not post-employment discrimination just because\nit concerns benefits that would be given after her employment?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nExactly.\nAnd --and I think this Court repeatedly had recognized that in the Title\nVII context before the ADA's enactment.\nIf you look, for example, at the Hishon versus King & Spalding case, the\nCourt described the scenario where there are benefits that are paid out\nafter employment ends, but there is still a claim with respect to those\nbenefits while the employment is ongoing.\nAnd there were also, as I said, several cases involving pension benefits\nwhere that was the fact pattern.",

So, even if\nyou are just, you know, focusing on that period before she retired, in\nthat period, she was indisputably a qualified individual. She was subject\nto the policy, all the things I said before.\nAnd so that would, I think, get you out of this -- this problem that\nyou've described.\n### Justice Alito:\nOh, all right.\n### Deepak Gupta:\nknow, it may come up in other cases.\nAnd -- and I think what the statute says is that the -- the unlawful\npractice occurs at three points: the adoption, when the person is subject\nto the policy, and then where the effects are felt.\nAnd Congress was specifically focused on claims with respect to\ncompensation and amended the ADA to make clear that -- that this\napplied to the ADA.\nAnd so I think that is Congress telling us that at this very kind of\nsituation where somebody is subject to the policy, that the -- the\nunlawful practice occurs there.",

Because, if\nshe's bringing a new claim, she has to be an otherwise qualified\nindividual.\nAnd it's not that easy to fit her situation at t hat time into the statutory\nlanguage.\nSo that's what concerns me about your argument.\nAnd could you answer --could you say why that is not fatal to your\nposition?"

The -- whoever drafted\nthis sentence was not -- was not very precisely speaking to the question\nof: Do you have to have this position at the time or not? They were sort\nof assuming that.\nAnd it says, you know, \"can perform the essential functions of the\nperson that such individual holds or desires.\" And then the question is:\nDo you have to hold or desire the position? And I think the best way\ngrammatically to understand that is that there are present-tense verbs.\nYou have to be able to perform the function.\nBut then the rest of the -- the part of the sentence after -- with the\nword \"that\" and after \"that,\" is a restrictive clause, modifying the\nposition.\nAnd so the thing you have to be able to perform is the essential\nfunctions of the job that you hold or desire to the extent that you hold or\ndesire a job.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nOkay.",

Is it the disparate treatment between\nemployees who work 25 years and then retire and those who work a\nshorter period of time and retire on disability? Is that it? Or does it have\nsomething to do with the change in the -- in the scheme?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nOkay.\nSo let me -- there are two questions in there.\nLet me take both of them.\nSo I quite agree that the reasonable accommodation concept is not\nreally going to do much work in this scenario, and one way you know\nthat is, if you look at the construction provision, (b)(5), when it's\ndescribing the reasonable accommodation requirement, it actually adds\non this language.\nIt says \"qualified individual who is an applicant or employee.\" And so I\nthink that is how Congress cabined the provision just to applicants or\nemployees.\n### Justice Alito:\nYeah.\n### Justice Alito:\nI don't see how it could work.\nSo, if it's --which is it? Is it the change, or is it the current status?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nI think it's both.\nIt is an ongoing discrimination.\nLet me -- so, first of all, I'd just emphasize that neither of the courts\nbelow aggressed -- addressed the actual merits of the -- of the\ndiscrimination claim.\n### Justice Alito:\nNo, I --I understand that.\n### Justice Alito:\nI'm just -- I'm just trying to understand h ow this would work -- how\n### Deepak Gupta:\nRight.\n### Justice Alito:\nSo you have a situation where your client says -- let's just take the\nongoing status.\nYour client says that I'm being -- I -- I -- I'm a victim of discrimination\nbased on disability because I should be treated the same way as\nsomebody who worked 25 years.\nHow is a court supposed to determine whether this distinction between\nsomebody w ho works 25 years and somebody who works a shorter\nperiod and retires based on disability is unlawful? What is the test for\ndetermining that?\n### Deepak Gupta:\nYeah.\nI mean, I think it will --it will turn a lot on the claim.\nLet me try to describe what I think is going on here, which is that before\nthis policy was put into place, the City was treating three groups of\npeople as equally deserving of the subsidy, so people who had\ncompleted 25 years of service, people who had completed a combined\nyear -- 25 years of service when taking into account military service and\nother firefighting positions, and then people who retired with -- with a\ndisability.\nThat's the third category.\nAnd when faced with a budget shortfall, the City chose to only exclude\nthat third group, people with disabilities, from the subsidy despite the\nabsence of any evidence that it would ameliorate the shortfall.\nSo the City singled out people with disabilities solely because of their\ndisabilities.\nAnd, in fact, we know that the City has told a disabled retiree who did\nhave 25 years of service that he still could not have the subsidy because\nhe had, after 25 years, become disabled.\nSo what -- what we would, I think, want the opportunity to do on\nremand is to show that the City treated Lieutenant Stanley differently\nbecause of her disability.\nIf she weren't disabled, she would have made it to 25 years and gotten\nthe subsidy.\nAnd if the City didn't singled out --single out disabled people, she\nwould have gotten the subsidy.\nOf course, the City will have the opportunity on remand to show why\nwe're wrong and --in their view.\nAnd whether you think the underlying claim is doomed to fail or\ndestined to succeed, the -- the question presented is the same.\nAnd I do think these are difficult claims to succeed on.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, you've said -- you've said a lot.\nAnd I -- I -- I'm not asking -- I -- I -- I'm not talking about the validity\nof this particular claim.\nI just don't know how this is going to be approached.\nWhen you have --you have structured retirem ent benefits, distinctions\nare going to be made.\n### Deepak Gupta:\nRight.\n### Justice Alito:\nSo part of what you said seems to me -- seems to be that the City just\nhad irrational bias against people with a disability, okay? That would be\none -- one argument that might be made.\nAnother part of what you seem to have said is that they didn't really\nhave a -- an economy --a valid economy rationale.\nBy not extending the benefits to people who retire with disability, they\nreally weren't going to save any money.\nBut suppose there's no evidence of -- of bias and, presumably, they will\nsave some money and they say, look, we need to cut -- we needed to cut\nback, so we cut -- this is where we cut back and we have a reason for it.\nThe reason is that we want to reward people who work for us for 25\nyears.\nHow -- how is a court going to approach this kind of issue?\n### Justice Alito:\nBecause, if you take out the reasonable accommodation question, I just\ndon't know how this is going to be -- how it's going to be approached by\ncourts in the future.\n### Deepak Gupta:\nWell, Justice Alito, you mentioned, you know, a structured benefit plan\nand the ability to make sort of actuarial sorts of decisions.\nAnd Congress actually did focus on this precise problem when it drafted\nthe ADA, and it included a safe harbor provision.\nThat's Section 12201(c).\nAnd that immunizes plan sponsors, plan administrators, insurance\ncompanies, from these kinds of risk-based decisions.\nAnd, in fact, your opinion in the Ford case, your concurring opinion in\none of these decisions comprising the circuit split, mentioned that safe\nharbor.\nAnd I think that actually, to the extent that the amici on the other side\nare hypothesizing a flood of claims, the reason you haven't seen that in\nthe Second and Third Circuits is because that safe harbor provision takes\ncare of and immunizes defendants from -- from the large, you know,\nmajority of those kinds of claims.\n### Justice Alito:\nAll right.\nThank you.

That paragraph of the complaint alleges\nthat she became disabled before she retired and also alleges that she\ncontinued to work until she retired. We think it's a plausible inference\nfrom that paragraph that she was a qualified individual with a disability\nat some point before she retired.\nIn the court of appeals, I would look at Romanette 8 and page 10 of her\nopening brief, pages 4 to 13 of her reply brief, and I would listen to the\nfirst five minutes of the oral argument below, in which Stanley herself\ndescribed the path I'm identifying here as \"the narrowest path to a\ndecision in her favor.\" And then, in this Court, I would -- I would cite the\nsame pages my friend cited in the petition, particularly pages 7, 11, 24,\nand 25. I would note that the City argued forfeiture in its brief in\nopposition.\nPresumably, this Court considered and rejected that forfeiture\ncontention as a basis for denying review and for good reason, because\nthis Court has said time and again that once a party has preserved an\nissue for this Court's consideration, that party can make any argument\nin support of that issue.\nAnd the issue here is whether Stanley satisfies the qualified individual\nrequirement.\nI want to emphasize why we think it's a good idea to decide this case\nnarrowly.\nFirst, we think it answers the question presented.\nSecond, we do think it would go a long way to resolving the circuit split.\nThat's identified at page 17A of the petition appendix.\nAnd the split implicates two decisions from the Sixth Circuit and the\nNinth Circuit, the McKnight decision and the Weyer decision, which\nboth held that former employees categorically cannot sue to enforce\nTitle I.\nAnd so, if this Court were to hold that at least someone in Stanley's\ncircumstances can sue even though she was a former employee when\nshe brought the suit, that would resolve that question that's divided the\ncircuits.",

And so long as you can\npoint to effects from that decision that do fall within the limitation\nperiod, then you can challenge that decision.\nWe -- we understand that to be the force of the Fair Pay Act in a context\nlike this.\n### Justice Alito:\nI don't want to take up too much time, but I am interested in the last\nquestions -- the last series of questions I asked Mr. Gupta.\nSo, in this case -- because I want to understand where this leads.\nIn -- in this case, Lieutenant Stanley is actually treated more favorably\nthan someone who retires after 20 years without a -- for a reason other\nthan disability.\nShe is treated less favorably than someone who retires after working for\n25 years.\nSo how is a court -- put aside -- there's no question of -- of bias, and\nthe -- the -- the employer puts that -- puts forward information that\nthis is based on cost saving and incentivizing working until 25.\nHow is a --what is the test for determining whether something like that\nis valid or not? The reasonable accommodation concept would work in\nthe employment context, but it doesn't work here.\nSo what's the answer?\n### Frederick Liu:\nYeah, I don't think this is a reasonable accommodation claim.\nI don't think Stanley has ever brought a reasonable accommodation\nclaim.\n### Justice Alito:\nOkay.\nIt's not reasonable accommodation.\n### Frederick Liu:\nRight.\n### Justice Alito:\nSo how do you determine whether this kind of a structure is -- is\ndiscriminatory?\n### Frederick Liu:\nSo we understand this to be a disparate treatment claim, and we\nunderstand that the right way to go about analyzing a disparate\ntreatment claim is to ask how a similarly situated person without\ndisabilities would be treated.\nAnd, as you know, the United States hasn't taken a position on this\nissue, but I -- I understand the parties to have staked out two different\nways of identifying the relevant similarly situated comparator.\nI think, if you ask Petitioner, what they would say is: What you do is you\nsubtract disability from the equation and you see what would have\nhappened then.\nAnd, in their view, if you subtract disability from the equation, their\nclient, Stanley, would have worked more than 25 years and, thus, been\neligible for benefits until she was 65.\nNow the City responds and says: Well, when you subtract disability from\nthe equation, that's all you subtract out, and you hold the terms of\nservice constant at 20 years.\nThey -- they would say that -- that Petitioner is changing two\nvariables, not only the -- the disability but also the terms of service.\nAnd so the City says: A similarly situated person with only 20 years of\nservice and no disability wouldn't have gotten benefits in this case, so\nStanley should lose. I think that's the form of the disparate treatment\nanalysis that should occur in the courts below.\nBut, as my friend pointed out, neither court analyzed the issue.\nIt doesn't affect this Court's consideration of the qualified individual",

Conner:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Title I of the ADA prohibits\nemployers from discriminating on the basis of disability only against an\nindividual who can perform the job she holds or desires, present tense.\nThis Court has explained in Robinson that use of present tense verbs is\nan unambiguous temporal qualifier limiting a statute to reach to current\nemployees only. Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit correctly held that\nbecause Stanley cannot establish that the City committed any\ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could perform the essential\nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her Title I claim fails.\nIndeed, the City's 24-month rule on its face is applicable only to\nunqualified individuals who retire because they are unable to perform\ntheir jobs.\nHowever, Petitioner argues that the City subjected her to its polic y\nwhen she was a qualified individual during her employment.\nBut a qualified individual is not subject to a policy that only applies to\nunqualified individuals, just like a man is not subject to a policy that\napplies only to women, and a non-disabled employee is not subject to a\npolicy that only applies to disabled employees.\nThis proposition is so well-established that the Petitioner did not plead\nthat the City's policy discriminated against her as a qualified individual.\nInstead, the district court, at 26a, held that her Title I claim failed\nbecause her complaint alleged that the discrimination did not occur\nuntil plaintiff was no longer able to perform the essential functions of\nher job. This ruling should not be controversial.\nEveryone agrees, for example, that an employer does not violate Title I\nwhen it fires an employee who can no longer perform the essential\nfunctions of their job.\nThe outcome should be no different here simply because retirees or\npost-employment benefits are involved.\nThis Court should affirm.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Conner:\nOur argument is just slightly more nuanced.\nIt's the fact that this particular policy only applies to unqualified\nindividuals.\nSo what she's saying is discriminatory is the fact that she only received\nthe health insurance subsidy for 24 months after she retired and those\nwho had 25 years of service read the -- received the health insurance\nsubsidy to age 65.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo you're not saying that any retirement policy only applies to\nunqualified individuals.\nYou're saying this particular retirement policy only applies to\nunqualified individuals.\nAnd -- and -- I'm sorry for being dense, but tell me why.\n### Jessica C.
