  "background": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe'll hear argument next in Case 23-1067, Oklahoma versus the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\nMr. Mansinghani.\n### Mithun Mansinghani:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: EPA actions to\napprove or disapprove state implementation plans are the prototypical\naction reviewed in the regional circuit.\nAs I believe Mr. Stewart confirmed in the previous argument, all parties\nagree at this point that if EPA had disapproved Oklahoma's and Utah's\nplans in separate Federal Register notices, those would be locally\napplicable actions.\nSo when it comes to applicability, the only disputed question is whether\nthe disapprovals of these state plans are transformed into a single\nnational action because EPA chose to process and publish them together\nwith the disapprovals of 19 other states. But the text of the Act's venue\nprovision directs the courts to look at the statutory authority under\nwhich EPA took its action, not the form of publication.\nHere Section 7410 authorizes EPA to take local action, approval or\ndisapproval of state implementation plans.\nEPA's position that the form of publication dictates the action's\napplicability for venue purposes has no basis in the text of the statute\nand, indeed, is at war with it.\nThat leaves EPA's backup, that the Oklahoma and Utah disapproval\nactions must be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit because they are based on a\ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\nThat exception, however, only applies to actions where EPA arrives at a\ngeneric conclusion that applies uniformly to all states and that forms a\ndispositive reason for the agency's action, irrespective of local factors.\nAs Justice Gorsuch's and Kavanaugh's questions earlier today indicate,\nEPA's reading applying that exception any time EPA articulates a rubric\nor a standard and then applies it to a local circumstance would mean\nessentially every local EPA action is one that is based on a nationwide\ndetermination.\nThe Court should reverse the decision below and send this case back to\nthe Tenth Circuit.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

      "dialogue": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart.\nWelcome back.\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Let me just\nmake two or three observations and -- and then take questions.\nThe first is that there's been colloquy in both of these cases about the\npropriety of EPA getting deference on a question about what forum the\ncase will be heard in. Under the statute, EPA has some influence on the\nquestion of whether the case, all challenges to a particular action will be\nheard in a centralized forum or whether, instead, they can be brought all\nthroughout the country.\nAnd if EPA chooses the former course, the fact that the cases go to the\nD.C. Circuit, the fact that the D.C. Circuit is the centralized forum, that's\nthe choice of Congress.\nThat's not the choice of EPA.\nAnd so it's not the case that EPA can direct challenges to whatever court\nit wishes.\nThe second thing I would say, and this goes back to the NRDC cases that I\nmentioned earlier, that when Congress was studying the venue\nprovision in preparation for the 1977 amendments, it had in mind the\nSIP approval actions that had taken place and been challenged in many -\n-in NRDC cases. And when it chose the path that EPA's general counsel\nrecommended, rather than the path that ACUS recommended, it\nwanted to ensure that there was some mechanism available for review\nof national issues, even when they pertained to the approval or\ndisapproval of SIPs.\nAnd, finally, Justice Kagan, you said something to the effect that under\nEPA's framework here, as opposed to the framework in the case before,\neven once you got past the 1 percent threshold, the 1 -- the questions\nabout the propriety of the 1 percent de minimis threshold, there was still\na lot of work to be done.\nAnd I think the analysis is complicated, but at the end of the day, EPA\ndisapproved 21 plans.\nIt approved, I think, 23.\nI believe that all 23 plans that were approved were approved on the\nground that the state fell under the 1 percent de minimis threshold.\nSo as a practical matter, the determination of whether a particular state\nexceeded the 1 percent threshold had great predictive effect in terms of\nwhether the plan would be approved or disapproved.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Stewart:\nWell, I would say they do require analysis of particular state\ncircumstances, but they -- they are still national in scope and they still\nwere contested; that is, EPA received comments indicating that\nchallenges to even the subsequent steps of the analysis were not simply\ngoing to be we accept these factors, but we think we satisfy them.\nThey were going to be challenges to the factors themselves.",

Stewart:\nI -- I mean, I think that just depends -- I mean, part of the awkwardness\nof the case is, the extent of the statute is the extent to which that is so\ndepends on the extent to which your challenges are to the national\ncriteria that EPA has promulgated or whether they are to the way in\nwhich those criteria are applied to your own state-specific\ncircumstances. And the more that the latter is the case, the more it\nmakes sense to be in the regional circuit.\nThe reason I say it's an awkwardness of the statute is the statute\nrequires that the venue determination be made as of -- at the time that\nthe action is taken, and it doesn't take into account what set of\nchallenges do particular petitions for review choose to make.\nAnd so the best we can do is have a test that tries to use proxies for\nactions that are -- as to which the national determinations are likely to\nbe the focus of judicial review.",

Stewart:\nI -- I mean, we see the specification of SIP decisions in prong 2 as\nreferring to decisions regarding an -- an individual SIP.\nAnd to the extent that we publish approvals or disapprovals of particular\nstate SIPs on a one -- one-to-one basis, we would agree that those are\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo you think the statute was really meant to distinguish between 1 and 2\non the basis of the EPA's publishing determinations?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nWell, I would say that the statute was meant to distinguish between 1\nand 2 on the basis of the action that EPA took. And if -- if you regard the\nno, you should probably disregard it.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAre they materially different? If what the EPA did here was separate out\nI see one -- one publication that lists each state separately and has the\nanalysis for each state separately.\nIf EPA put a page break between each one of the states and published\nthem differently, would you say that's a sentence 2 scenario?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI -- I don't think a page break would be enough, but if EPA issued\ndifferent -- you know, 21 different Federal Register notices on 21\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nWith the same kind of content as to the nationwide part of it, and then\neach one with a different analysis, how does this content, the\nnationwide content apply to the particular state involved, then we\nwould say that's a series of discrete state-specific actions.\nAnd in -- in a way the most straightforward way for us to prevail in this\ncase ultimately is on prong 3, because the analysis under prong 3\ndoesn't depend on what if any weight the court gives to EPA's decision\nto issue these, all of these in one Federal Register notice.\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo on the thought, the prong 3 determination, what --what is your view\nas to why this is still driven? I understand that you have four factors and\nyou're applying the four factors.\nAnd we would hope that that would be the case, that you would be\nassessing each state consistently using a set of criteria.\nBut I take your point that that's enough to make it a --a determination\nof national scope or application?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nWell, I mean, it is partly that they were the four criteria we were going to\nuse.\nIt was partly that they at least to a degree were new and contested.\nWe anticipated from comments we received on the proposed\ndisapprovals that the states would contest the methodology, not just its\napplication.\nThe other thing I would say is all of the states whose plans were\ndisapproved had proposed to take no further ameliorative action with\nrespect to ozone transport beyond what they were already doing.\nSo it would have been a much more complicated analysis if various\nstates had been planning to improve their plans in -- in different ways\nand EPA was required to make state-by-state determinations as to is\nthis good enough.\nIn -- instead, we had -- we approved a lot of plans that -- for states\nthat fell below the 1 percent threshold, disapproved a lot of plans for\nstates that in our view fell above it and that didn't propose to do\nanything additional.",

Stewart:\nThank you.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nMr. Mansinghani.\n### Mithun Mansinghani:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nTwo quick points.\nTo Justice Kagan's question about whether the four determinations\nwere sort of the be all/end all here, and it seems like Mr. Stewart seemed\nto think so with the 1 percent threshold, if you look at Oklahoma's plan,\nOklahoma said, look, even --even though we're above the screening\nthreshold, here's why our contributions are not significantly going to\ncontribute to non-attainment down-wind.\nLook at the trends in Oklahoma's emissions due to the specific structure\nof the Southern Power Pool and to how Oklahoma operates its electric\ngenerating fleet.\nAnd look at the dropping ozone levels in down-wind states like Texas,\nbecause of mobile source changes.\nEPA rejected those rationales, but nonetheless those were state-\nspecific things that ended up controlling the decision.\nSimilarly with Utah, Utah said based on a weight -- weight-of-the-\nevidence analysis, we don't think we're significantly contributing\nbecause in the west, as EPA had prior determined with states like\nArizona and California, the -- the relative contributions are relatively\nlow. Around 6 to 7 percent are coming from other states, very different\nfrom what's happening in the east.\nSo these were all very state-specific things that EPA had to -- to\nadjudicate, even after it got past all of those four determinations.\nThe second thing I wanted to talk about was where we are with the text\nof the exception.\nYou know, Mr. Stewart's test has a lot of atextual things to it.\nWell, it has to be a determination but a new one, not a -- not an old one.\nWe have to try to figure out where -- what -- what part of the action\nlitigants are likely to challenge.\nAre they likely to challenge the local aspects or the national aspects?\nThat --that seems like a very hard-to-adjudicate venue test.\nAnd it's also something that doesn't come from anywhere in the\nstatute.\nI think our test comes from the words \"based on,\" which in this Court's\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act decision in Sachs, I think takes a\nsimilar approach as we do.\nIt has to be the gravamen -- gravamen or foundation of the action and\nnot just an element.\nAnd in that case, this Court declined to apply the commercial activities\nexception in a unanimous decision, even though plaintiffs had alleged\ncommercial activities, because the Court said that alleging all of those\nthings alone still entitled plaintiffs to nothing.\nBut then you also couple that with the fact that I think the third\nsentence has to be read in conjunction with the first two.\nIt has to be things like are in the first sentence, like the setting of a\nnational uniform air quality standard or a national uniform standard of\nperformance for sources.\nCouple that with the types of cases that we talked about like the NRDC\ncases and Dayton Power cases and the fact that this is a venue clause, so\nit shouldn't be manipulable, and the fact that it's an exception, so it\nshouldn't be read to swallow the rule.\nI think all of that leads to -- to our test.\n\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you, counsel.\nThe case is submitted.",
