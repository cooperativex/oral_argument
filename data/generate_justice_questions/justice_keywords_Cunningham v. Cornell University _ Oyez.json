  "background": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe'll hear argument next in Case 23-1007, Cunningham versus Cornell\nUniversity.\nMr. Wang.\n### Xiao Wang:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted\nERISA, it identified a number of prohibited transactions and codified\nthat understanding in 29 U.S.C. Section 1106.\nIn Congress's view, these transactions posed a special risk of being\npotentially harmful to the plan, generally because they involved a party\nin interest, which includes a fiduciary's relative or an officer or an owner\nof the plan or a person providing services to the plan.\nPetitioners here have identified a transaction that falls within the text\nof Section 1106, and the Second Circuit's decision to dismiss that claim\nprior to discovery was incorrect for three reasons. First, text and\nstructure.\nCongress frequently writes laws where it puts liability in one part of the\nstatute and exceptions to liability in another, and when it does so, this\nCourt has time and again held that plaintiffs plead and prove liability\nand defendants plead and prove exceptions to liability.\nSecond, precedent.\nIn Keystone Consolidated and Harris Trust, this Court made clear that\nthe prohibited transaction provisions provide for categorical rules.\nBut what the Second Circuit's approach does is it conver ts those\ncategorical rules into qualified ones.\nAnd that brings me to the final reason for reversal, which is that they're\nnot just qualified prohibitions, but they're qualified based on\nexemptions that involve information that plaintiffs cannot know and do\nnot know prior to discovery, information like who the counterparties are\nin a cross-trade or how large a block trade is or what asset classes are in\na block trade, which is exactly why, when Congress wrote these\nprovisions, it intended for petitioners to plead and prove under Section\n1106 and for defendants to plead and prove under Section 1108.\nFor these reasons, Your Honor, we ask this Court to reverse the\njudgment of the Second Circuit.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Standing is another one.\nWhat do you think you have to plead to establish standing? Do you have\nto plead anything more than that I am -- I am being charged for\nrecordkeeping services? Do you think you have to prove that the charge\nis excessive or do you -- in order to have standing at the pleading stage?\n### Xiao Wang:\nWell, Justice Alito, I think that that's a little bit of an open question after\nthis Court's decision in Thole. Certainly, I think, with Thole, perhaps one\ntake-away is that, yes, you would have to show, because simply\nshowing record -- simply alleging recordkeeping would be pleading an\ninjury at law and rather than injury at fact.\n### Justice Alito:\nSo all you have to plead -- you have to plead I was charged too much,\nand that's -- that's enough to establish standing?\n### Xiao Wang:\nI think, in the appropriate case, yes.\nHowever, I think that, again, this goes back to --to -- to the other\nguardrails that might be there, which are fee shifting and -- and -- and\nquestions about the -- the -- sort of the expense of even bringing one\nof these cases.\nSo -- so I think these all work together to explain why, in the Eighth\nCircuit and the Ninth Circuit, we don't see cases that have these sort of\nbare-bones threshold complaints.\n### Justice Alito:\nAnd what do you think about the procedure that the Solicitor General\nrecommended involving Civil --Rule of Civil Procedure 7?\n### Justice Alito:\nIs that -- do you think that's a possible -- that that is something we\nshould say is a --is a good practice?\n### Xiao Wang:\nI think that that is one of several options that would be available to a\ndistrict court to address perhaps these concerns over a bare-bones\ncomplaint.\n### Justice Alito:\nA district court could do that? A district court could say, after the answer\nis filed, I want a reply, and then rule on whether it can be determined\nbased on the pleadings if the defendant is entitled to judgment on the\npleadings?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCertainly, Your Honor.\nI think that's how we would see it.\nOf course, a district court could have other options available to it, such\nas limited discovery or an expedited summary judgment motion, as\nwell.\n### Justice Alito:\nDo you think that that's -- that should be mandatory for the district\ncourt to go through that -- well, I'll ask the Solicitor General that.\nI have no more questions.\nThank you.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Sotomayor\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI do.\nThis isn't that easy a case in my mind.\nYou're right about the general rules we've set, but this statute is slightly\ndifferent because many of the cases that we've seen before, the\nprohibitions were on one page and the exemptions were in a different\nsection, but the prohibition didn't reference the exceptions the way this\nstatute does.\nIt says, except for the exemptions in 1108, you can't do the following.\nOn the other hand, there's 21 exemptions within 1108, but I also\nunderstand there's dozens, if not a hundred more, that have been\npassed by the Department of Labor.\nAnd if we accept the other side's position that you have to prove the\ncase and say there's no exemption, I don't know how you'd know that.\nYou're right, how will you know which exemptions are pertinent or not,\ncorrect?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCorrect.\nCorrect.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd so that's really the problem in this case, which is either -- whatever\nwe decide, someone's going to be potentially unfairly treated because\nyou have --no plaintiff has a way of knowing what all the exemptions\nare and what potential exemptions the other side could pick.\n### Xiao Wang:\nCertainly, Justice Sotomayor.\n### Xiao Wang:\nSorry.\n### Xiao Wang:\nApologies.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nOkay.\nThat's a given.\nBut, here, it's pretty clear that you alleged and you thought you had\nsome sort of burden because I read your very extensive complaint, and\n### Xiao Wang:\nCorrect.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nYou allege it's unreasonable.\nYou show a lot of other fees. I'm not quite sure still, and I will ask the\ngovernment this, under normal pleading standards, I would have\nthought this was enough.\nI think that the Second Circuit was thinking that it has to be pled with\nTwombly and Iqbal as a fraud and that you needed more particularized\ninformation relating to the nature of the services in total, some\ninformation that you say you couldn't have known.\n### Xiao Wang:\nYes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nYou just knew how much was being paid and you compared it to what\nother people were paying.\n### Xiao Wang:\nComparable plans, yes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nExactly.\nSo, if I have a problem with that part of it, that the Second Circuit may\nhave asked for more than you needed to plead, what do I do?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nEven if I accepted their proposition that you need to allege for whatever\nreason a pleading standard, injury standard, that you have to allege\nsomething more than that they have a transaction, do I get to address\nthat or I don't, or what am I doing here?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCertainly, Justice Sotomayor.\nI think that what you're doing here is -- is, first, I think you would\nreverse. We -- we would ask this Court to reverse the judgment of the\nSecond Circuit.\nAnd it would reverse by saying, look, you --if these are enough under\nIqbal and Twombly and it involves unreasonableness, then whatever\nrule you apply, we would still say that there was a legal error here. But, if\nI can get back to what I think may be the first part of your question,\nwhich is perhaps the relative weakness of our --of our decision about\nthe \"except as otherwise provided\" language at the top, well, first, I\nthink that precedent answers this point, and precedent answers this\npoint in a couple different ways.\nOne is Respondents have provided no cases where that actually changes\nthe calculus. It turns except -- the words \"except as otherwise\nprovided\" magically turns the word -- the exempt -- exemptions into\nelements.\nThere's no case on that point.\nIn fact, the cases like Atlantic Richfield and Schlemmer make fairly clear\nthat all that's doing is saying w hat happens when things clash.\nIt doesn't expand or contract the liability provisions at all.\nAnd I think, sort of maybe as a concluding point on this point, that is\nreinforced by the structure and the complexity and the nuance that's\nprovided in 1108 that involves an information asymmetry that -- that,\nagain, cannot be addressed prior to discovery.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI'm going to ask the other two about the Second Circuit factual ruling,\nwhich was that with respect to this provision, you have the burden of\nshowing unreasonableness, but it reserved consideration of whether\nthere were other exemptions that you didn't bear the burden about\nproving.\nI don't know how it got there at all.\n### Xiao Wang:\nRight.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd I'll ask the government and your adversary how we do that. But\nCook did say that -- established a narrow ruling for criminal pleadings.\nI don't think there's any case that ever has applied it to civil\nexemptions, correct?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCorrect.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo it's hard to rely on Cook, but the essence of its thinking was, if a\nprohibition looks like -- if a prohibition looks like it's -- you can't really\ntell it's illegal or not because the exemption here says you can have\nthese relationships, you can just have them with reasonable fees, then\nyou need for the -- for the government -- for the government to prove\nthey were unreasonable.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy wouldn't that apply here, that concept?\n### Xiao Wang:\nWhy wouldn't Cook's apply here?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nObservation.\n### Xiao Wang:\nYeah.\nI -- I --I think it wouldn't apply not simply just because of the\ncriminal/civil distinction that we talked a bout but also for the\ninformation asymmetries that you mention.\nAnd it doesn't sort of -- really, I think the Respondents are asking this\nCourt to sort of carve out the statute in a few different ways, to --to try\nto gerrymander it by saying: Look, we'll put the (b)(2) exemption, we'll\ntreat that as an element and we'll try to carve out service providers, and\nthen we'll stitch together 1106 and 1108.\nBut that's not how the statute is written.\nAnd, certainly, that might lead to some results.\nWe don't see that happening in the Eighth or Ninth Circuits, but, if it\ndoes, I think that's in Congress's province to address.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThank you.",

That's\nwhat I'm interested in.\nAnd I understand the argument that all that's necessary to be pled are\nth e elements of the -- the -- the -- the provision that creates liability.\nAnd those are the ones that I set out.\nAnd they --they say nothing about the reasonableness of the fees.\nI don't know how the reasonableness of the fees gets into the pleading\nrequirement if that's the way we go about it.\n### Yaira Dubin:\nSure.\nSo I think looking at this Court's decision in Iqbal, the language used\nthere was a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual\ncontent that allows a court to draw the reasonable inference that the\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\n### Justice Alito:\nIt's reasonable liability as to the elements, not reasonable liability as to\naffirmative de fenses that may or may not exist and may or may not be\nasserted.

Saharsky:\nYeah.\n### Justice Jackson:\nWhat -- what's your response to that?\n### Nicole A.

And then what do we do\nabout the information asymmetry, the fact that plaintiff could not\npossibly know many of them?\n### Nicole A.

Are they all elements, all 21\nexceptions?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nWith respect to 1106(a) claims, which include the exemption and\notherwise would be only innocuous conduct, then, yes, the relevant\nexception in Section 1108 would be an affirmative defense, but not all of\nthem would be relevant in every case on the facts.\nAnd I think you can think about this in terms of what a plaintiff has to\nplead to go forward with a complaint.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI'm sorry.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nI said that you would -- that a plaintiff would have to plead facts\nregarding the one that was -- regarding the transaction, the type of\ntransaction, that's applicable in their case.\nSo, for example, there are some that involve block trades or cross-\ntrades or buying employer stock.\nAnd no one was doing any of those things here, so there's no\nrequirement to plead those kind of facts.\nThe plaintiff's burden is not to plead legal conclusions but to plead facts\nthat show an entitlement to relief.\n### Justice Jackson:\nNo, I understand the plaintiff's burden generally.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nYes.\n### Justice Jackson:\nelements in the 1106 context.\n### Justice Jackson:\nYeah.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nincludes every kind of transaction you could imagine with a plan, the\nonly thing that the Petitioners say is exempted is the thing that this\nCourt exempted in the Lockheed versus Spink decision, which is paying\nbenefits to a beneficiary, but it covers pretty much everything else in the\nworld.\nThe definition of \"party in interest\" is literally an \"everyone and their\nmother\" provision.\nAnd so these -- this broad range of transactions has to be understood\nwith respect to the exemptions in Section 1108.\nAnd, yes, they would be elements as applied based on the facts of the\ncase.\nBut you just plead the facts that are relevant to the transaction at issue.\nAnd so, for this transaction, there was never any question that what was\nat issue was a service provider transaction.\nThe exception that was relevant was the one for -- for reasonable fees,\nnecessary fees, et cetera.\nAnd if, for some reason, there was a case in which a plaintiff pleaded and\n### Justice Jackson:\nCan I just -- can I -- can I ask you about potential problems for other\nstatutes that are created in this same way? I mean, do we have to worry\nthat if we're suddenly saying that the exemptions in this structure are\nelements that we're going to implicate things like the Federal\nArbitration Act, which has a similar dynamic?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nI don't think it's a problem because this Court considers each case and\neach statute as it comes.\nThat's what it has been doing since the decision in Cook, where it said,\nlook, if we look at something and it's called an exemption and it's in a\nseparate provision, we probably would think it's an affirmative defense,\nbut there are some circumstances in which we don't, say, if there's a\ncross-reference to the provision or it's direct -- there's some other way\nthat it's directly incorporated or, for example, if the conduct that is in\nthe initial prohibition covers so much beneficial innocuous conduct that\nyou think we can't define the wrongful thing that Congress was trying\nto get at without -- without using the exemption.\nAnd that's the inquiry that this Court has done, and that's the inquiry I",

Saharsky:\nRight.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAnd -- and the context would seem to be key on that.\nAnd some of the concerns that we've been discussing or I've been\nraising and the amicus briefs raise, others have raised, would suggest\nthat this -- the context here suggests it doesn't make much sense to\nread this 1106(a) that way.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nRight.\nSo I'd point the Court to four factors.\nOne, the incredible breadth of Section 1106(a), which reaches so much\ninnocent conduct, nothing wrongful, not limited to wrongful conduct by\nitself.\nThen you have the cross -reference, which says: Okay, we don't have to\nread it by itself.\nWe're being told that we should read it with Section 1108, which is what\nlimits it to the wrongful conduct.\nAnd then you don't see that cross -reference in Section 1106(b), which is\nthe one that defines only wrongful conduct, only transactions that\ninvolve self-interest in conduct.\nSo you think I've got to give some meaning to that language that's in\n1106(a), the cross-reference, but not in 1106(b). Petitioners' view does\nnot give any meaning to that language.\nIt is superfluous.\nAnd then the fourth thing I think about is that there are other parts of\nERISA where Congress either encouraged or expressly required the use\nof service providers.\nAnd I think to myself: Well, Congress said that plans have to do this and\nevery plan does it, so it would make no sense at all to say that Congress\njust defined the cause of action as using a service provider.\n### Nicole A.

Another one is\nstanding, expedited discovery, coupled with a motion for summary\njudgment, fee shifting, sanctions.\nWhy are -- are they not sufficient?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nRight.\nBecause the rule is that a plaintiff has to come to court and plead the\nelements and doesn't have to plead affirmative defenses.\nNow, if the Court -- and that's -- that's how Iqbal and Twombly are\nunderstood. That's what it means to bring a claim to court and plead\nfacts to show an entitlement to relief.\nIt's entitlement to relief on -- on the elements.\n### Justice Alito:\nOkay.\nWhat about the Rule 7 workround?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nSo we think that that is kind of convoluted and discretionary and that's\nthe problem with it . First of all, there would not be an opportunity to\nRule 11 -- Rule 7 just applies to an answer.\nSo the Court has discretion about whether the Court can -- whether it\ncan -- it asks for a reply brief or not.\nSo I guess what the government is thinking is the plaintiff pleads the\nmere fact of a service provider transaction.\nThe defendant says no, this --it is a --for reasonable fees and necessary\nservices.\nAnd then, at that point, the court should exercise its discretion to\nrequire the plaintiff to plead additional facts to show that the fees are\nunreasonable or the service is unnecessary.\nThe problem with that is that it's discretionary.\nA plaintiff could go to a district court that's favorable, not -- the district\ncourt would say: I don't want to do that.\nAnd then it's off to discovery and off to summary judgment.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, could we say that in the --in the particular circumstances here, it\nwould be an abuse of discretion for the district court not to follow that\nprocedure?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nThe Court absolutely could say that.\nI guess my suggestion would be is that the Court should be very clear if\nthat's what the Court wants, because that's not the way that things\nhappen now with respect to Rule 7. And so the Court would -- would\nhopefully say that in those circumstances, in --in the case of a service\nprovider transaction, that if the defendant alleges that the fees were\nreasonable, the services were necessary, something in Section 1108,\nthat then the district court absolutely should require the plaintiff to\nrespond and plead facts to show, plausibly show, that the fees were\nunreaso nable. I mean, our bottom line, which I understand to be the\nsame as the government's bottom line, although I'm not entirely sure,\nis that the plaintiff should not be able to just come to court and say\nthere was a service provider transaction, that's bad, we're off to the\nraces with a lawsuit.\n### Justice Alito:\nOkay.\n### Justice Alito:\nsummary judgment motion?\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nSo I will address each of those, but let me just say none of these\nsupposed solutions or guardrails are working now in the district courts,\nand that would be before the Court announced a rule that you could\nperhaps just go in with a service provi der transaction.\nAnd just one point on that.\nYou know, there have been two dozens lawsuits that have been filed\nagainst university plans.\nIn none of them has a court found that the plaintiff succeeded on the\nmerits.\nThis has been, like, millions of dollars that these universities have spent\non discovery and individuals who have been named personally and had\nto live under a clued for years and years.\nSo this idea that there are these great guardrails that are going to solve\nthat problem, that's not happening now, and that's before Petitioners'\nposition gets accepted.\nBut, to -- to specifically answer your question, I don't know that\nstanding is a solution because standing, establishing an -- an -- an\ninjury for standing is different from establishing an entitlement to relief\nunder a cause of action.\nI don't know what injury a plaintiff might claim.\nI mean, I think Petitioners' theory is that the mere fact of paying money\nto a service provider is an injury because Congress decided that that was\nbad or at least presumptively bad.\nSo now there's been a suggestion that the injury would be unreasonable\nfees, but I -- that --that, to me, gets us back to, well, aren't the\nunreasonable fees part of the elements, so the cause of action.\nSo I -- there's also the possibility of jurisdictional discovery and\nstanding, which, you know, makes it seem to me like not a very great\nsolution.\nAnd I guess the last thing I would say on that is, you know, if -- if -- if\nthere is a standing problem or a -- some other constitutional problem\nwith the statutory interpretation the Petitioners are suggesting, that\nwould be a good reason not to do that thing and to take the other\nreading of the statute, which is much more reasonable.\nI mean, nearly every court that's looked at this and, you know,\napparently, the Solicitor General say Petitioners' position just can't be\nright, that just cannot be right.\nAnd there has to be a way to make sure that the plaintiffs have some\nburden to plead something more.\nAnd there's a really obvious way to do that, which is to say, well, in this\ncircumstance, we understand that Section 1108 helps to define the\ncause of action, to say that this is actually something that the plaintiffs\nhave to plead.\nAnd I -- just to get back to a -- a point",

There's\nmaybe a handful of factual circumstances where -- that have been\nlitigated in the courts of appeals that involve fees for services,\nparticipant loans, some cases with buying employer stock or property,\nlike employee stock ownership cases, things like that.\nThere's kind of a handful of these.\nI don't think any of them have led to circuit splits.\nI don't think that there's --there should be much concern about the\nCourt, you know, adopting a rule that's going to have spillover effects\nfor any of those.\nAnd so I guess, you know, what we would say is that the Court should\ndecide this case just as it decides, you know, all of the cases that come to\nit, which is on the language of this particular provision.\nAnd we appreciate that the government is, you know, trying to help find\nthese solutions to the problems with Petitioners' position, but I think,\nat the end of the day, they're not happening.\nThey're not working now. I think they're discretionary.\nI -- I -- I -- the suggestion about, like, well, maybe there could be\nexpedited discovery or not much discovery because you could just look\nat the face of the service provider -- the contract and see if it's good or\nnot good, well, that hasn't been happening in these cases.\nI mean, the -- the --there have been experts on both sides to discuss\nwhether the fees are reasonable or not.\nYou know, discovery has gone on for years and years.\nThese university cases started in 2016, and they're still going on now.\nSo I just would caution the Court before thinking that any of those\nsuggested solutions would be real solutions.\nCould you just go back to the suggested solution of the government? I\nthink you said to",

Saharsky:\nSure.\nSo, if the solution is that a plaintiff has to plead unreasonable fees or\nunnecessary services, then that is a great result, but we just want that to\nbe clear, that that is the obligation that the district courts would\nenforce.\nSo there are two ways that the government suggests getting there, and\nthey both seem kind of convoluted to us and also have this discretionary\naspect that we're concerned about.\nThe first way that the government suggests is on motion to dismiss.\nThe idea would be that in response to a motion to dismiss, that a\nplaintiff would have to plead additional facts to show that the fees were\nunreasonable or the service is unnecessary. But, like, why would the\nplaintiff have to plead that, because it's not an element? The\ngovernment says it's an obvious alternative explanation.\nWell, we think that that misunderstands, for the reasons Justice\nGorsuch gave, what the obvious alterna tive explanation doctrine is.\nIt's like a reason that the element isn't met.\nLike, in an antitrust complaint, the allegation could be, well, a whole\nbunch of companies did the same thing. But an obvious alternative\nexplanation is, well, they --they all did the same thing because of\nmarket forces.\nSo it wasn't that they did, you know, the bad thing, which was a\nconspiracy.\nHere, what Petitioners define as, you know, the bad thing is jus t the\nservice provider transaction.\nAnd the fees being reasonable isn't an alternative explanation for\nwhether there was a service provider transaction or not. It's like an extra\nfact. Now, if the Court wanted to revisit Iqbal and Twombly and say that\nit also imposes a burden on plaintiffs to negate affirmative defenses,\nthat would be terrific.\n(Laughter.)\nBut it would be, I think, a --a sea change in the law that would have\neffects well -- well past this case. So that's their Option 1.\nAnd then I think we've discussed a little bit more their Option 2, which\nwas Rule 7.\nSo Option 1 was for the motion -to-dismiss stage.",

Saharsky:\nRight.\n### Justice Kagan:\nIf you feel like you have more to say on Rule 7, go ahead, but -- but that\nwas what I wanted to know about.\n### Nicole A. Saharsky:\nI -- I just think, if the --if the Court wanted to pursue a Rule 7 solution,\nit should, please, make clear that that is something that district courts\nhave to do because it is discretionary and there's not judicial review of it,\nand these cases could go on and on and on.\nI would like to say one other thing, though, about Rule 7 and --and this\nparticular case, which is, so assuming that the plaintiffs do have some\nburden to plead unreasonable fees, we think the Second Circuit correctly\nfound that they didn't plead it here and that this Court, you know,\nordinarily doesn't review that kind of holding, like the application of a\nlegal principle to particular facts, but, if it did, you know, it would be\nclear here that there's, like, no reason for a remand.\nSo just to --just to explain what the Second Circuit did, you know,\npleading that fees are unreasonable, of course, is just a legal conclusion,\nso you need some plausible facts to show why they're unreasonable.\nHere, you know, there was an allegation that the fees were too high, but\nthere wasn't any allegation of what the services were for or that there\nwere other university plans that had comparable services that had much\nlower fees.\nAnd that's all the Second Circuit was saying.\nIt didn't say anything about Cadillac plans.\nIt just said, like, we don't know if something is too high unless we know\nwhat it's for.\nWe don't know -- we need to know, you know, what services it's for.\nIs it more services? Is it fewer services? Is it better services? And that's\nnot a weird rule in the Second Circuit.\nThat's actually the same thing that, like, the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth,\nTenth Circuits have said in these unreasonable fee cases, which is you\ncan't just plead, like, high fees in the abstract and say they're too high.\nYou have to give us some plausible facts as to why they're too high,\nwhich are, you know, compare them to something else that's like your\nplan where they didn't pay those kinds of fees. And so, you know, we\nthink the Second Circuit was exactly right to say that.\nThe only other thing I'll say just because the government put this in\nissue is that, you know, there's no point in a remand in this case because\nthe plaintiffs actually had the opportunity to try to adduce, you know,\nevidence through years and years of discovery to try to show that the\nfees were unreasonable.\nThat was, I think, as",
