  "background": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe'll hear argument next in Case 23-217, E.M.D. Sales versus Carrera.\nMs. Blatt.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For over a century, this\nCourt has held that the default standard in civil cases is preponderance\nof the evidence.\nThat default rule should resolve this case.\nNothing in the text suggests that Congress intended a clear and\nconvincing evidence standard to apply to the 34 exemptions under the\nFair Labor Standard -- Fair Labor Standards Act.\nRespondent --Respondents argue that a heightened standard is\nappropriate because FLSA rights are important.\nBut a preponderance standard applies to rights against race\ndiscrimination and disability discrimination and rights to organize and\nto workplace safety, all super-important rights. This Court has reserved\nthe clear and convincing standard to deprivations by the government of\ncritical rights that don't involve money damages.\nThis Court has never allowed plaintiffs to use a clear and convincing\nstandard as a sword, and it certainly has never read a clear and\nconvincing standard into a statute for money damages.\nRespondents also argue that overtime rights aren't waivable.\nBut waivability and standards of proof are unrelated and don't go hand\nin hand.\nWaivability goes to who owns the right, the government or the\nindividual, and the standard of proof goes to how hard it is to prove that\nthe right attaches in the first place.\nThus, the preponderance of the evidence standard governs non-\nwaivable rights, such as those under the NLRA and OSHA, and\nheightened standards govern waivable rights, such as those in criminal\ntrials and deportation hearings.\nBecause the court below applied only the clear and convincing standard,\nwe think this Court should remand for the application of the\npreponderance standard.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Blatt:\nSure, a couple things.\nI mean, I do think public nature goes to the waivability, and as my\nopening talked about, that's a distinct issue in terms of standard of\nproof.\nBut, more importantly, the public has an equal interest in the accurate\nimplementation of the Act, and this Court in Encino said the exemptions\nare equally a part of the statute. And the public has an interest in\nmaking sure, if it's more likely than not an employee doesn't fall within\na category and should be exempt, then, under a clear and convincing\nstandard, that employee may be required to pay overtime even when\nthe purposes of the statute are not only not --not invoked, but they're\ncounterproductive because it imposes very unjustified costs,\nparticularly under small businesses.",

You asked us to vacate and remand.\nThe SG wants us to reverse, which usually suggests to me that they\nthink the judgment below can't be sustained under any reading.\nAnd the other side says, regardless of the standard, affirm.\nOur practice is to remand.\nBut what outcome could a different standard of proof have on the\nfactual findings in this case?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nSo let me address just sort of the -- I don't think at least we intended\nany difference between vacatur and reversal.\nWe just copied what the Court did in the Starbucks case because it\ninvolved a similar misapplication, so we just took identically what you\nsaid in your opinion.\nI don't think the government's --I think the government and -- and we\nboth just think send it back.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWell, I don't disagree just for a moment.\nI do think the other side says this was harmless error.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nOf course.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right? So I don't think we should get into that.\nThe court below should.\nBut I'm asking you, why isn't it harmless error?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nRight, yeah.\nSo we think the ultimate --we think there's more than ample evidence\nfor the Court to find and will find below by a preponderance of the\nevidence.\nAnd the main reason -- and the regulation is cited at page 43A of the\nthis is an outside salesman -- it's not the time spent, but it's the most\nimportant, i.e., the character and time spent is one factor but not\ndispositive.\nAnd the four things that we would point to --and I think, again, the\nevidence is -- is great for us -- one, it's the testimony of the CEO, which\nis that just when she started the business, your job is to make sales.\nIt's to push that inventory and to increase the product.\nAnd, second, there were three salesmen that said that the sky was the\nlimit for them and their ability to make sales at chain stores and they\nlost track.\nThird, there was testimony of the Walmart former buyer for sauces and\ndressings and either he or she --I can't remember -- said that\nplanograms, which are basically your floor plans for your inventory\nshelf, that those were honored in the breach.\nIt's true that the Safeway and Giant people said we can't control where\nwe put the food, but the Walmart person said: Listen, sometimes we let\nthem, you know, sell us more tortillas or whatever they were selling and\nget more space.\nAnd finally, and the fourth one, and I think it is important at least to our\nclient in terms of common sense, they are called sales representatives,\nand the collective bargaining unit designated them as such, and nobody\ncomplained about overtime.\nSo this was a, you know, longstanding provision in the -- in --in the\nCBA.\nSo I think all of those things would lead to a sufficient basis.\nAnd the only way this Court could find harmless error, of course, would\nbe to find that no reasonable fact finder could find by a preponderance\nof the evidence.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nOn the last issue you raised, which was the collective bargaining issue,\nthis right of o vertime is not waivable by an employee, correct?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nCorrect, prospectively, yes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nBut you're not using it in that sense.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nNo, not at all.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nYou're using it in the sense of what they perceived as the most\nimportant part of their function?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nAbsolutely correct, that it was just the union, you know --and they were\npaid on a commission basis.\nIt necessarily wasn't based on new sales.\nSo this is more completely atmospherically inconsistent with their title,\nnot in any way -- not in any way binding.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThank you.",

Blatt:\nCorrect, yeah, just the Tenth Circuit.\nNow -- and I don't think -- again, we tried en banc, and I don't think\nthe Fourth Circuit has ever articulated a rule.\nAnd it is somewhat noteworthy that they've only applied it -- I mean,\nthey're doing it in the overtime case too, which seems, you know, the\nleast policy basis for it.\nAnd the only other thing I just want to say on the preponderance of the\nevidence is the district court said just in the connection of the hearing,\nthere's a lot to be said on the liability question.\nObviously, a throwaway. The district court's going to make its own\nindependent decision on remand, but we don't think there's anything\nthat could be said where this Court sitting as -- as nine members would\nfind that no reasonable fact finder could conclude that a preponderance\nof the evidence wasn't satisfied.",

The cases -- many of\nthe cases that are cited are actually post-1938 cases.\nSo what's the best evidence that Congress was actually legislating\nagainst the preponderance of the evidence standard?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nIn that Footnote 2, where we list all the cases, there are only two cases to\nbe sure that were pre-1938.\nIt's the Lilienthal's Tobacco from 1877, I think, and United States versus\nRegan, which is 1914.\nBut that case is a civil penalties case, when it was basically saying, even\nthough you're hit with these civil penalties, you could be subject to a\ncriminal law, preponderance of the evidence standard applies.\nNow, in Regan, what the Court did was not only cite treatises, but it\ncanvassed state law and federal cases.\nIn the Lilienthal's Tobacco, it just cited two treatises, and I think those\ntreatises are -- I don't know.\nI have the dates, but they're in the 1800s, and they're Wigmore and\nwhoever else the famous evidence person is.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd it was general civil litigation?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Jackson:\nMm-hmm.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nAnd so, you know, the civil penalties.\nSo it's just -- and then, besides just those treatises and the two\nSupreme Court cases, it's the -- I think the government did make a\ngood argument that Congress, when it thought about the issue in the\nadministrative context, said it thought preponderance of the evidence\nwas sufficiently protective of workers in the minimum wage context,\nwhich I think is a little more sympathetic for the worker, so it's worse for\nthe other side.\nAn d I'm -- I don't -- oh, go ahead.",

So, I mean, when Congress enacted\nthe FSLA --the FLSA, they talked about the fact that there were\ninterests at stake that were beyond money damages, that setting up the\nstatute in the way that they did ensured that businesses don't gain a\ncompetitive advantage by misclassifying employees.\nIt protects certain groups from substandard wages and thereby\nprotecting health and well -being. There was also the notion of\nspreading employment through the application of this law. So isn't this\nmore than just money damages? I mean, I take your point that it might\nnot be denaturalization, but I would think the government would say\nthe interests go beyond just pure money damages.\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nCertainly, we recognize there are very important policy interests at\nstake in this case and in the FLSA and that Congress legislated with\nthose in mind.\nI think the same thing is true for Title VII.\nIt's not just about the individual employee who's seeking damages.\nIt's about the broader interest in eradicating discrimination from the\nworkplace.\nCongress often makes these policy findings in its statutes where it lays\nout all of the interests that are at stake here, an d those can be\naddressed through a variety of means, for example, through this\nwaivability issue or waivability aspect of the statute where it can't be\nwaived.\nAnd so that is how some of those policy concerns are addressed.\nBut the heightened standard of proof has just never been used as the\nkind of tool that would -- that would be addressed in those kinds of\ninstances. Otherwise, I think it would -- it would risk making that\nstandard no longer -- the preponderance of the evidence may no longer\nbe the default standard in those cases because those kinds of interests\nare --are very frequently at stake when Congress is legislating.\nI -- I wanted to just make a couple -- a couple of points if there are no\nfurther questions on --on that.\nThe Respondents have -- have asserted the variety of reasons to depart\nfrom the default here, and the Court has never accepted those kinds of\nreasons in cases dealing with conventional remedies.\nAnd I think it's important here to note that no court has actually\naccepted them because the Fourth Circuit here, as Ms. Blatt already\ndiscussed, did not actually come up with any reasoned basi s for the\ndecision.\nIt -- it misconstrued this earlier precedent, but it never tried to\nreconcile the heightened standard of proof with the Court's precedents\nhere and with the -- the very narrow set of circumstances in which the\nCourt has suggested that it would be appropriate.\nSo the -- the reasons that Respondents have provided here are\ngenerally the policy interests in --in -- in overtime requirements,\nwhich, again, we agree are important, but other statutes also implicate\nvery important reasons. And, as this Court held in Grogan, I think the\nexemptions here are also a part of the congressional policy and are also a\npart of what Congress was doing when it was balancing the interests\nhere.\n### Justice Jackson:\nCan I ask you, is this the same standard of proof that would apply to the\ngovernment, the Department of Labor, if it is bringing suit to enforce\nthe FLSA?\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nYes, it's the same standard of proof.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd it's the same standard that the Department of Labor applies in its\nown administrative proceedings?\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nSo the Department of Labor does it -- the Department of Labor enforces\nthis statute through district court litigation.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThrough the courts.\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nSo it would always be the -- the same standard.\nOPM -- there are other administrative --OPM administers it for the\ngovernment on behalf of --of government employees, and those go\nthrough litigation as well and the same standard.\n### Justice Jackson:\nDoes the government have an idea of how often the standard of proof is\ndispositive in a case like this or any other?\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nIt's difficult to say.\nI mean, the amicus and --and the parties here have tried to kind of point\nto various cases where they think the standard may or may not have\nbeen dispositive.\nIn the Department of Labor's cases, its own litigation, where -- where\nwe might have more of an idea, the standard of proof I think is -- is\npretty rarely dispositive, but that's likely because most of the litigation\nin the context of the Department of Labor is about the interpretation of\nan exemption or, you know, whether an employer is -- an employee is -\n- is covered by the FLSA at all, whether they are an employee or an\nindependent contractor.\nSo, in those cases, in the cases that the Department has --has litigated,\nI don't think it often makes a huge difference, but it certainly can make\na difference in edge cases here, and I think that the Petitioners should\nbe given the opportunity to show that this is one of those cases.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd one final question --oh, sorry.",

Bateman:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When neither the\nConstitution nor any statute sets a standard of proof to govern a\nparticular factual determination, the degree of proof required for any\ngiven claim or defense is a question traditionally left to the judiciary.\nHere, application of the clear and convincing standard of proof is\nnecessary to carry out the explicit public purpose of the Fair Labor\nStandards Act.\nSection 202(b) of the Act declares that it is designed to eliminate as\nrapidly as practicable labor conditions that fall below a minimum\nstandard of living.\nThe preponderance of the evidence standard falls short of that purpose\nbecause it allocates the risk of factual error equally between employers\nand workers. But the FLSA is not your typical civil statute where only\nindividual monetary damages are at stake, and so, as far as the public is\nconcerned, the interests of plaintiff and defendant are in equipoise.\nInstead, it's a statute that prot ects both the worker's right to a fair\nday's pay for a fair day's work but also the public's right to an economic\nsystem that doesn't depend on and inexorably lead to the\nimpoverishment and immiseration of the American worker.\nCongress implicitly recognized in Section 202(b) that the social\ndisutility of a factual error that deprives a worker of minimum wages or\novertime to which he's entitled is greater than the social disutility of\nimposing those costs on the employer.\nAnd that lopsided disutility analysis, under principles long recognized\nby this Court, calls for requiring the employer to prove an exemption\nclearly and convincingly.\nIt's also appropriate because employers are likely to possess and control\nevidence relevant to these kinds of factual determinations.\nAnd employers can and sometimes do manipulate evidence in their\nfavor, such as job descriptions or titles.\nUnchecked, these factors lead to disproportionate errors of fact finding\nin favor of employers.\nThus, it's sensible to insist that where an employer seeks to prove that\nan employee is exempt from these protections, the employer must do\nso clearly and convincingly.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Bateman:\nYou're right, Your Honor, it is --it is a preponderance of the evidence\nstandard.\n### Justice Thomas:\nSo why should FLSA be treate d more advantageously than the\ndiscrimination cases?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nI think the key difference between the FLSA and Title VII is waivability.\nAnd Title VII vindicates certainly extremely important rights, but\nalthough Title VII vindicates a public interest, it doesn't expressly create\na public right separate and independent from the right that accrues to\nthe individual. And I think an example might be illustrative here.\nAn individual can feel free to sign a severance agreement saying: I agree\nto waive any Title VII claims that might have accrued during the course\nof my employment for $50.\nBy contrast, this Court has said that private waivers of FLSA back wages\nor liquidated damages would, and I quote, \"nullify the purposes of the\nAct.\" So you cannot waive or compromise those claims unless there's a\nbona fide dispute as to the amount owed.\nSo, if an employer were to do the same thing in the FLSA context and say\nthat he would settle his claims for $50 and it was later found that the\nemployee was owed a hundred dollars of back wages, that waiver just\nwouldn't be operable.\nThe Department of Labor or the employee could still pursue that\nremaining $50 in litigation.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Jackson\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo I'm discerning a methodological difference between the two of you\nthat I'd like to ask about.\nPetitioner said that the standard of proof question is ultimately a matter\nof congressional intent.\nAnd I take you to be pushing back on that a little bit by your opening\nwhen you said that when there's no constitutional requirement and\nCongress is silent, the standard of proof is a question traditionally left to\nthe judiciary, and you seem to be inviting us to be weighing these\nvalues.\nAnd I thought, at least the way Petitioner has set this up, is that it's not\nour role to do that, that what we should be doing, she says, is\ndetermining whether Congress's silence meant that it acquiesced to the\ndefault rule, which is preponderance of the evidence.\nSo can you speak to the differenc e of methodology?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nCertainly.\nI think Petitioners' methodology is inconsistent with the way this Court\nhas actually analyzed standards of proof issues, and I think the\nimmigration cases are a really great example.\nStarting in Schneiderman, this Court grappled with the standard of\nproof in denaturalization proceedings, and those proceedings took\na host of evidentiary directives, but it didn't contain a standard of proof.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut isn't that because they were sort of -- I think everyone concedes\nthat there's this kind of special category of cases that based on their\ninterest, whether it's a constitutional interest or sort of quasi-\nconstitutional because of the nature of the deprivation, due process\nkind of thing, the Court has work to do.\nBut I thought we sort of got rid of that at the top by sort of assessing this\nnot as being in one of those categories, and so then the question\nbecomes: How does the Court treat it?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nWell, I --I think, again, the immigration cases are -- are a good\nexample.\nAnd I -- I take Your Honor's point that perhaps there's a quasi-\nconstitutional interest at play.\nBut -- but that interest is never articulated by the Court in\nSchneiderman or -- or in Woodbury.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut what do you do with Grogan? I mean, I thought from then on, the\nsort of way in which we thought about this was Congress --you know,\nthere's no constitutional interest here, Congress didn't speak to it.\nSo what does Congress's silence tell us about what it intended with\nrespect to the cause of action that it was creating?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nI -- I think cases like Grogan and Herman & MacLean are illustrative that\nour view of the methodology is the more accurate one because, in those\ncases, the Court did undertake a balancing analysis.\nIt didn't just observe a statutory lacuna and decide: Well, certainly,\npreponderance of the evidence applies.\nIt -- it weighed the interests at stake.\nAnd --and granted, in those cases, it determined after that weighing\npreponderance of the evidence was the relevant standard.\n### Justice Jackson:\nDid it do so on the basis of the Court's own view of the interests in stake,\nor was it trying to ascertain how Congress viewed those interests?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nI -- I think the -- the structure and nature of the statute is relevant to\nthe court's determination of how it manages these factual questions.\nUltimately, of course, courts will answer these sorts of procedural\nquestions consistent with general principles that have emerged from\nother cases.\nAnd those principles, I think, do embody a default rule in a weak sense,\nwhich is that when there's a statutory lacuna, those -- those questions\nare reserved for -- for the courts and that in civil litigation, issues tend\nto be decided under the preponderance of the evidence, unless the\nreasons that courts have developed for exercising a more stringent\nstandard apply.\nSo I think the question here is whether those reasons are present in this\ncase.",
