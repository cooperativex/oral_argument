Excuse me, a final order.\n### Keith Bradley:\nThe --the Court -- the statute allows the Court to conduct review\nwithin 30 days of a final order from removal, but it also clearly says the\nCourt has jurisdiction to review a CAT order as the Court explained in\nNasrallah already.\n### Justice Thomas:\nHave we ever said that you could do that independent of the final order?\n### Keith Bradley:\nI -- not independent in the sense -- and that is exactly the problem,\nYour Honor.\nI think that the sensible approach is to wait until the agency has\nconcluded all of its work, and then you have one petition that\nencompasses removability, the order of removal, and the CAT questions\nthat are at issue.\n### Justice Thomas:\nDoes the CAT question then convert the -- the final order into a broader\nfinal order by attaching itself to that?\n### Keith Bradley:\nI think what Nasrallah teaches us, like -- certainly, is that it does not\nconvert the -- a CAT order that says -- that -- that denies CAT relief is\nnot converting the final order into something else, except from the\ntiming of it and what gets decided is affecting the finality, because as we\nexplained in the brief, and I believe the government agrees, where you\ncan be sent is something that remains to be decided.\nThe -- the removal order under the government's regulations has to tell\nyou where you're going to be sent.\nYou have an opportunity to object right --right then.\nIf the process results in that being -- that -- that where not working,\nthen they are going to tell you where else.\nAnd then you might proceed into another.\nSo -- so it does not affect the removability.\n### Justice Thomas:\nSo do you have -- what's your best textual hook for that?\n### Keith Bradley:\nI'm sorry, for -- for which, hook for what?\n### Justice Thomas:\nFor your --for your argument that the CAT order has to be -- it can\nexpand the time limit of the final order.\n### Keith Bradley:\nSo it -- it turns on what \"final\" means, Your Honor.\nAnd the -- the statute, we submit, obviously it explains what makes\nsomething final in certain circumstances. And aside from that, it's a\nword that this Court has interpreted in many contexts to mean that the\nagency's decision-making is full and complete on all issues, that the\nagency has disassociated itself from the decision-making process.\nThat's the word \"final.\"",

I also think that if the Court were to adopt amicus's\nreading of the statute, one potential upshot of that is that Congress\nintended to foreclose review of these claims. And if Congress wanted to\nforeclose review of these claims, we don't see how courts and litigants\ncould adopt a work-around scheme to get around that.\nBut obviously our front-line position is that Congress did want review of\nthese claims.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nI think your friend on the other side would say: Well, they can file these\nprotective appeals and courts of appeals can hold onto them and -- and\nthen when the CAT order matures, you're good to go.\nWould courts of appeals have to keep those notices of appeal on their\ndocket?

I haven't encountered that.\n### Ephraim McDowell:\nI think this points up another problem with this idea, which is that I\ndon't actually think it's a particularly effective way of preserving\njudicial review because these procedures lie within the discretion of the\ncourts of appeals.\nAnd so some courts of appeals may deny a motion to hold a case in\nabeyance.\nSo I think we would end up with a patchwork system where some circuits\nare generally preserving review of these claims; others are not.\nAnd there might be even variation within circuits.\nWe also see some other practical problems with the system.\nOne is that it leads to a flood of meritless prophylactic petitions which\nreally aren't challenging the removal order itself.\nThey're just a placeholder for a later decision that may actually go in the\nalien's favor.\nThe second problem is that it creates a trap for the unwary because\nmany people in this system are unrepresented and won't know that\nthey have to file this sort of counterintuitive protective petition.\nAnd then, finally, it does create administrative burdens for the courts\nand for the government.\nAnd what we've seen in practice is that many of these protective\npetitions end up being abandoned at the end of the day because the\nperson gets withholding relief or because they just don't want to pursue\nthe petition.\nSo it really is just a waste of resources in many cases.",

So if there were a\nsituation where a person didn't raise it for 30 days after th e entry of the\nSection 1228(b) removal order, we would agree that at that point, the\norder would be final and the petition for review timeline would have run.\nBut here, and as -- as is usually the case under the regulations, these\nclaims are brought contemporaneously with the entry of the Section\n1228 removal order.\nThe problem is that the resolution of those claims takes much longer\nbecause these are often very fact -intensive claims, as opposed to a\nSection 1228(b) removal order, which has very little process because it's\nmeant to be expedited.\n### Justice Alito:\nAnd how long -- do you know, by any chance, how long on average it\ntakes to resolve CAT claims?\n### Ephraim McDowell:\nWe don't have exact numbers, but my sense is it usually takes several\nmonths if it's a real -- if it's a serious claim.\nIf it's a meritless claim, these can be resolved fairly quickly because the\nasylum officer will say that there's no negative -- or there's no\nreasonable fear.\nThen the immigration judge will sustain that.\nAnd both of those officers have to make those decisions within a 10-day\nspan.\nSo they can sometimes be resolved relatively quickly.\nBut here, when it's a serious claim, here the IJ actually found that he was\nentitled to CAT -- to CAT relief, and then that was reversed by the BIA.\nWhen it's a serious claim like that, it could sometimes take several\nmonths to even over a year.\nThe dissent in Guzman Chavez pointed to some instances where they\ntook multiple years, I believe.\n### Justice Alito:\nSo as between the two -- in light of that, as between these two options,\nwhich one is preferable and why? The first would be the requirement\nthat a prophylactic petition for review be filed, and the second would be\nyour position that there's no need to do anything until after the CAT\nclaim is resolved.\nDo you think that your -- that there's a risk that your position would\nlead to greater delay?\n### Ephraim McDowell:\nI don't think it would lead to greater delay because people are going to\nhave incentives to bring these withholding-only claims no matter what\nbecause they can always bring the claim before the agency, and the\nremoval order will be stayed pendency --pending the agency's\nresolution of the claim.\nSo these claims are going to be brought either way if there's a plausible\nreason to bring them.\nand I'm setting aside the protective scheme which I've already\ndiscussed -- but the delay here would be the time needed for the court\nof appeals to review the withholding -only determination. I also want to\njust point out, in terms -- in terms of the -- any public safety concerns\nabout giving this additional time or additional process to aggravated\nfelons, it's important to bear in mind that they can be detained\nthroughout the entirety of the agency proceedings, as well as\nsubsequent judicial review proceedings.\nAnd this Court affirmed that power in Guzman Chavez.",

Hammer:\nSo two responses, Your Honor.\nFirst, I don't think judicial review of orders concluding withholding-only\nproceedings is precluded by the Fourth Circuit's reading. The parties\nhave identified various ways by which aliens could obtain review of\nthose orders.\n### Justice Barrett:\nSo let's -- if -- if those aren't, let's -- in this hypothetical, just assume\nthose are off the table.\n### Stephen J. Hammer:\nYes, Your Honor.\nIf those are off the table, if those are not valid, then I think this is a\nunique form of judicial review.\nI'm not aware of another one that is like this.\nIt allows CAT claims to be reviewed but only if you file a petition for\nreview of a final order of removal.\nSo I'm not aware of an -- an analogy to it, but I don't think it would be\nsurprising, if Congress meant to restrict judicial review, that it would do\nit for these particular classes of aliens, aliens who have been convicted\nof felon -- felonies and illegal reentrance.\nThat would not be a surprising class, given Congress's interest in\nexpediting the removal of those aliens.\n### Justice Barrett:\nIs that consistent with the presumption of judicial review?\n### Stephen J.

Hammer:\nWell, I think it wouldn't preclude you from getting the judicial review if\nthese alternative means are available.\nIt would just require you to file the protective petition and hold it in\nabeyance, which the government represents has been done in the\nFourth Circuit since its decision.\nAnd I think this Court has been clear that administrative burden or\ncomplexity is not a reason to depart from the plain meaning of the\nstatute.\nBut I also think there was a good reason for Congress to do it this way.\nAnd I think this relates to the policy consequences of Mr. Riley's and the\ngovernment's position.\nSo Mr. Riley's and the government's position separates administrative\nfinality, on the one hand, from finality for purposes of judicial review, on\nthe other.\nAnd by doing so, they create a risk that aliens can be removed from the\ncountry to a third country during withholding-only proceedings\nwithout ever having the chance to go into court and get a stay.\nThat's a significant policy problem, and that's because, as everyone\nhere agrees, the final administrative removal order is administratively\nfinal as soon as it's issued.\nThat authorizes the government to remove the alien to a third country\nso long as the government provides notice of that and the alien doesn't\nhave a fear of persecution or torture in that country.\nBut as long as withholding-only proceedings are ongoing, according to\nMr. Riley and the government, there will not be a judicially final order,\nand so the alien won't be able to go into court and get a stay.\nThat's a particularly significant problem because there will be cases in\nwhich aliens both want to challenge the validity of their 1228(b) orders\nand seek withholding relief.\nAnd those aliens will be put to a difficult choice.\nThey will either need to forgo their withholding proceedings so that\nthey can immediately get judicial review and a stay of their 1228(b)\norders, or risk it, go into withholding proceedings knowing that there's\na chance they might be removed to a third country before ever having\nthe chance to go into court and get a stay.\nThat cannot happen on the Fourth Circuit's reading because the Fourth\nCircuit's reading marries administrative finality with finality for\npurposes of judicial review.",

Hammer:\nJust to mention that -- the definition a little bit more, Your Honor, I\nthink the best way to understand this, that is a statute-wide definition.\nIt applies by its terms to the entirety of the INA.\nSo it covers Section 1228(b).\nAnd I think the best way to read it is to reconcile it with 1228(b),\nparticularly in light of the history of the two provisions.\nThe predecessor to Section 1228(b) that originally dispensed with the\nneed for a hearing before an immigration judge was adopted in 1994.\nDOJ adopted regulations implementing it in 1995. They did away with\nthe need for any Board review.\nSo by the time Congress came to AEDPA in 1996 to add this definition, it\nalready had this part of the statute.\nIt already knew this statute called this \"a final order of deportation,\"\nand yet it adopted this definition.\nI think the best way to read it together with that is to reconcile it, to say\nthat Board -- the period for Board review expires immediately when no\nBoard review is allowed.\nBut if you disagree with me on that, I think Section 1228(b) itself\nanswers this question, and it's strongly supported by Section 1231 and\nwhat this Court said about administrative finality in Guzman Chavez.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWhat do you say about the possibility that some courts of appeals won't\nallow these protective appeals to sit on their books for years on end?\n### Stephen J. Hammer:\nYour Honor, I think this Court could provide guidance about the\nsituations in which those motions for abeyance should be granted.\nThe Court has done something similar in the habeas context in -- in\nRhines versus Weber, where it authorized a stay in abeyance procedure\nfor district courts so that habeas petitioners could go into district courts\nand exhaust their -- go into state court to exhaust their claims before\ncoming back.\nThis Court could authorize something like that. I don't think that's\nnecessary here, Your Honor, because I think the meaning of the filing\ndeadline is plain.\nBut the Court could provide guidance in that way.",

      "dialogue": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nCounsel, you say that Stone's rejection of tolling indicates that it's a\ntrue jurisdictional holding.\nBut tolling can be unavailable in equitable proceedings as well, can't it,\nor when the deadlines are -- are equitable?\n### Stephen J. Hammer:\nYes, Your Honor.\nIt is true that some claim processing rules also foreclose tolling, but they\ndon't do it in the way that Stone did.\nSo this Court in Irwin held that non-jurisdictional statutory deadlines\nare presumptively amenable to equitable tolling.\nWe see nothing like a rebuttal in Stone of that presumption of equitable\ntolling.\nInstead, we see the automatic and reflexive connection of the Court's\nholding that the deadline is jurisdictional to the consequence that it\ndoesn't allow for equitable tolling.\nThat's the exact opposite of what happened in Beggerly, the Court that\nthis -- the case that this Court analyzed in Wilkins and said didn't count\nas a definitive jurisdictional precedent.\nIt had an extensive analysis of equitable tolling.\nAnd the Court said if it was a true jurisdictional deadline, it wouldn't\nhave needed that extensive analysis.\nAnd that's exactly what we have in Stone; a direct and immediate\nconnection between the conclusion that the deadline is jurisdictional\nand the consequence that it doesn't allow for equitable tolling.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWell, you also argue that the citation of the cert deadline and the appeal\ndeadline is very, very significant here, but those seem to be quite\ndifferent in the sense that you're dealing with the vertical deadlines of\nquite some significance.\nAnd I wonder whether that is a particularly compelling analogy.\n### Stephen J. Hammer:\nYour Honor, I think it was the analogy that the court found compelling in\nStone.\nIt was the analogy that supported the Court's ultimate conclusion that\nthe deadline was jurisdictional and engaged in this extensive analysis,\ncomparing the deadline to file a notice of appeal from a final order of\ndeportation to the time to notice an appeal from a district court\njudgment, which as you point out this Court has recognized as\njurisdictional, both before and after Arbaugh.\nThe Court also compared the effect of the motion for reconsideration to\nthe effect of a Rule 60(b) motion, which doesn't strip the court of\nappeals of jurisdiction.\nAnd I think that --the force of that analogy is that it shows the court\nunderstood the filing deadline as a window of time at which the court of\nappeals could assert jurisdiction, regardless o f any motion for\nreconsideration, and after which it would could not assert jurisdiction\njust like in the notice of appeal context.\nI think all of that analysis supported what happens on pages 405 of\nStone and shows that the Court truly meant what it said when it said\nthat the deadline was jurisdictional.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Kagan\n### Justice Kagan:\nMr. Hammer, when I asked you before why we should think of the order\nof removal as final, given that it's distinctly non -final, distinctly\nprovisional as to an important aspect, which is where you're going to\nremove the person to, you countered to me, Nasrallah.\nIs there anything else that you would say about that question or is this\nlike you think, look, that's what Nasrallah forces you to do is to think of\nthat order as final, even though it's not final, as to where the person can\nbe removed to? Is there anything else other than Nasrallah?\n### Stephen J. Hammer:\nYes, Your Honor.\nI think it's a strong point that this order allows the removal, even while\nwithholding-only proceedings are ongoing of the alien to a third\ncountry. The order does not have to be amended.\n### Justice Kagan:\nWell, it does -- so it has settled the question of whether you can remove\nthe alien to, you know, any other country, but it has not settled the\nquestion as to whether you can remove this person to Jamaica here.\nSo that continues to be an up-for-grabs question. And as I understand\nthe government's argument, it's like as long as that's an up-for-grabs\nquestion, the order is not final. Now, you come back and you say\nNasrallah.\nSo I take the point.\nWe have to now go read Nasrallah and see what it said and what it didn't\nsay, but I'm not hearing anything else from you.\n### Stephen J. Hammer:\nYour Honor, no.\nI think the statutory text itself, so we talked about 1228(b) and the clear\nindications that that order is final when issued.\n1231 also confirms\n### Justice Kagan:\nYeah.\nI'm sorry. What in that tells you it's final as issued?\n### Stephen J. Hammer:\nIt's called the final order of removal.\n### Justice Kagan:\nMy question is what is a final order of removal?\n### Stephen J. Hammer:\nSo Section 1228(b)(3) indicates that you can seek judicial review within\n14 days of the issuance of the order, which would not be possible if\nwithholding-only proceedings suspended the finality of that order.\nSo I think that's a strong indication that it's final, but I would also point\nto Section 1231 and what this Court said about administrative finality in\nGuzman Chavez, because many of these arguments were also raised in\nGuzman Chavez, that indeterminacy as to the \"where\" question\nsuspended the finality of the removal order.\nAnd the Court rejected that for purposes of administrative finality in\nGuzman Chavez.\nI think there's a strong presumption that also governs finality in Section\n1252.\nAnd we can see evidence of that in the statutory text in Section 1252(b)\n(8)(A), which cross-references Section 1231 and uses the words \"a final\norder of removal\" to indicate the beginning of the removal period under\nSection 1231.\nSo Congress is using these two terms interchangeably.\nAnd for the reasons we discussed, it makes sense for them to do them so\nbecause administrative finality is the point at which the alien is then put\nat risk of being removed to a third country.\nIt doesn't make sense to have judicial --finality for purposes of judicial\nreview be suspended for some period of time, while the alien is at risk of\nbeing removed to a third country.\n### Justice Kagan:\nThank you.",

Rebuttal Mr. Bradley, rebuttal?\n### Keith Bradley:\nThank you.\nA couple of observations, really three things I'd like to say.\nOne is on the question whether somebody can be removed to a third\ncountry, while the withholding proceedings are in process, I'd like to\npoint the Court to the regulation at our Appendix 29A in the petition\nthat says, \"such alien shall not be excluded, deported, or removed\nbefore a decision is rendered on his or her asylum application.\" And that\nterm is defined in the regulation to include the withholding claims. So it\nis, as the government and we have said, that while they have the\nstatutory authority to remove you to somewhere else, the actual\nadministrative process is that by their own regulations they cannot,\nunless they find another --they designate another country. This is\nactually 20A in the appendix, that they must designate the country of\nremoval and then give you another chance, if that's -- if it's a third\ncountry, you, like, might raise an objection as to that one.\nBy contrast, in the -- in the judicial process, of course, there is no\nautomatic stay. This was a change in IIRIRA.\nWe have a stay in this case, but that is within the discretion of the circuit\ncourts.\nI'd like to come back to 1228(b)(3). This is the provision that says that\nthere's a pause for 14 days.\nThat has a great deal of force in a case where there is no withholding\nclaim, but there's nothing about that provision that --that shows it was\nintended to ensure -- to cover every case.\nIt is a limited protection of limited benefit for certain circumstances.\nNot all of them.\nThird, I'd like to come back to this question of the protective petitions.\nIt is more than simply that the courts would have to hold them in\nabeyance.\nThe government is right about the volume, that you will have to petition\nin every case because you won't even know yet what the BIA's decision -\n- what the IJ's or BIA's decision will be and whether there will be\ngrounds to challenge it.\nIn addition, you will have to be filing a petition in response to which the\ngovernment is supposed to file the administrative record for a case that\nis still ongoing and you're still building the administrative record.\nSo the -- the headaches for doing this nationwide are contrary to any\nother judicial review scheme that I can think of.",
