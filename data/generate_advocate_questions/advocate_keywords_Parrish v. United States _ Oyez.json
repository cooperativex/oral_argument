  "background": "While serving a 15-year federal prison sentence in 2017, Donte Parrish sued the United States for $5 million, claiming prison officials unlawfully held him in administrative segregation for three years. After the district court dismissed his case in March 2020, Parrish did not receive notice of the dismissal until June 2020 due to his transfer to state custody. He promptly filed a notice of appeal, which the appeals court treated as a request to reopen his appeal time. The district court granted this request in January 2021, giving him 14 days to file a new appeal, but Parrish missed this deadline and instead sent a supplemental brief to the appeals court a few days late. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Jackson\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo I -- I'm struggling with your argument, and the reason is because I'm\nnot sure that ripening is really the best way to think about what is\nhappening here.\nIn my view, the notice of appeal was not actually premature.\nI mean, it was late with respect to the initial -- the initial period, but\nlateness doesn't necessarily doom your position because, in this\ncontext, we have a separate set of rules that allows for a late-filed notice\nof appeal to be deemed timely if certain conditions are satisfied.\nAnd I guess what I keep coming back to in my mind is what happens in\ndistrict courts every day when people file late, let's say it's a motion or a\nbrief or whatever, and they have a motion for an extension of time\nattached to it. It comes in together, the motion of -- for extension of\ntime and the brief they want to file late.\nAnd when the court grants the motion, the clerk dockets the brief.\nThere's not, like, an extra determination that the person needs to refile\nthe brief or it needs to come in, you know, in certain -- it's there already\nbecause they submitted it along with.\nSo, in that situation, I guess I just don't understand, nobody thinks of it\nas ripening.\nThese things arrived at the same time, which is sort of what's\nhappening here. The notice of appeal came in, and it was construed as\nhaving a motion to reopen as a part of it or construed as being a motion\nto reopen. So why do we even need ripening to get to the result that you\nare seeking in this case?\n### Amanda Rice:\nI -- I think I agree with just about everything you said,\n### Justice Jackson:\n. I\ndon't know that the -- there's anything to the concept as ripe -- of\nripening as magic words. This Court used that language in FirsTier.\nIt also talked about the notices of appeal relating forward.\nBut -- but I don't think there's anything magic about those words. I -- I\nthink the logic that you're articulating is similar to what this Court said\nin Lemke, which is just that a premature notice of appeal is filed within\nBut I guess what I'm saying, it's not premature.\nLike, the -- these things happened at the same time.\n### Amanda Rice:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Jackson:\ndon't have the -- the name of the case right in front of me --but, you\nknow, there are -- there are times when something will come in before\n### Amanda Rice:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Jackson:\nnotice to take effect, and you say, okay, it ripens at the time that the\njudgment happens.\n### Amanda Rice:\nYeah.\n### Justice Jackson:\nDo you understand what I'm saying?\n### Amanda Rice:\nI -- I do.\nIt was the same document in this case.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThe mode --it was the same document.\n### Amanda Rice:\nIt was the same document.\n### Justice Jackson:\nIt was the same document.\n### Amanda Rice:\nIs the concept.\n### Amanda Rice:\nYeah.\nI think it's not always the same document.\nYou could file a notice of appeal and then realize you needed to file an\nextension motion or a motion to reopen. I think that happens too.\nYou're certainly right that these -- this often arises in the context of pro\nse litigants.\nIt's often one document.\nBut it doesn't have to be if it's filed before a motion to reopen, at least\nbefore the motion to reopen is granted.\nit's not with respect to the motion.\nIt's with respect to the granting of the motion.\nSo the motion is filed at the same time as the notice, that's absolutely\nright.\nBut reopening isn't granted until after the motion is filed.\n### Justice Jackson:\nNo, I understand, but in -- for a motion for extension of time for late-\nfiled documents, the same dynamic exists. The motion comes in stapled\nto the document, and the court has to grant the motion in order for the\ndocument to be deemed timely.\nI mean, what we're doing here is just deciding whether this notice of\nappeal is -- should be deemed timely.\nAnd we have rules related to it.\nIt's not timely with respect to the first set of rules.\n### Amanda Rice:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut it could be if the court finds the conditions related to motions for\nreopen exist, and they do.\nSo, I mean, I just wonder why the court of appeals didn't just docket this\nwhen it came back to them, having had the district court find that the\nmotion to reopen was --the conditions were granted.\n### Amanda Rice:\nI -- I wonder that too,\n### Justice Jackson:\n.\nI think every other court of appeals would have.\nThese are ordinarily just treated as notices of appeal that have become\neffective, in your language, have been deemed timely.\nThey're deemed timely as a result of the conditions.",

Brown:\nMm-hmm.\n### Justice Jackson:\nthe window of when you're supposed to file a notice of appeal.\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nRight.\nSo I think that the best way to understand this is that it's both too late\nand potentially too early.\nIt's too late with respect to the appeal period that has, of course, already\nexpired, but it's too early with respect to the possible, potential\nreopened appeal period that might occur.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI understand.\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nRight.\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nThe same time as the motion.\n### Justice Jackson:\nYes.\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nBut not at the same time that the motion is granted.\nAnd so, once the motion is granted, the idea of relation forward is that\n### Justice Jackson:\nRight.\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nto the date of the motion for an answer.\n### Justice Jackson:\nNo, I understand, but we don't do that with respect to other motions\nthat are filed potentially too early relative to when they are granted.\nI mean, my -- you know, we don't do that.\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nSure.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd so it's just a weird thing to suddenly say that even though this\nmotion and the document to which it relates were filed at the same\ntime, we're going to somehow give, you know, life to the notion that\nyou don't grant the motion until later and so then we say the document\nhas to catch up with that in some way.\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nSo I think that this probably comes from the statutory text here, which\nholds -- or which -- which states that the motion to reopen grants an\nappeal period for the -- for 14 days from the date on which the motion\nwas granted.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI understand, but wouldn't --wouldn't the simplest, most\nstraightforward way to deal with this is just to clarify in interpreting the\nstatute in a situation like this one in which the motion and the\ndocument arrive at the same time, that 14-day period is obviously\nsatisfied.\nIt's here.\n### Aimee W.

      "dialogue": "Justice Jackson\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo, to be clear, are you quibbling with the Court's decision to construe\nthe notice of appeal as a motion to reopen?\n### Michael R. Huston:\nNot at all, Justice Jackson.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAll right.\nSo you say there are two steps.\nAnd he clearly, you know, messed up on the first step.\nThe court cured it by saying we're going to treat this as a motion to\nreopen.\nI guess I don't understand why they also can't treat the second step as\nhaving been satisfied by the early filing of the document?\n### Michael R. Huston:\nI think it's because of Bowles, Your Honor.\nRecall that in Bowles, the petitioner there filed a motion to reopen but\nthen ultimately filed the notice of appeal too late, after the 14-day\nperiod, and the Court said it's a very harsh result, but the statutory text\nsimply dictates the period when that notice of appeal must be filed.\n### Justice Jackson:\nNo, I understand. But he didn't file a notice of appeal.\nIn this case, he did, and it was the court that construed it as the --as the\nthreshold motion to reopen.\nAnd it just seems odd to me that having construed a document as a\nmotion to reopen for the purpose of allowing for a document to be filed\ncalled a notice of appeal, when you have the document there, why\ncouldn't the court also then say, okay, we have the notice of appeal\nwithin the window that we've just opened and we're done?\n### Michael R. Huston:\nBecause that's not -- there's no general practice.\nYour Honor, as you were describing in the colloquy with my friends is\nexactly right, that with lots of different kinds of documents, courts do\nfile this procedure.\nYou -- you -- you make a motion to lodge an amicus brief and you\nattach the brief, motion to file an amended complaint, but it doesn't\n### Michael R. Huston:\nIt has jurisdictional significance obviously in some respects, Your Honor.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI mean, let -- let's explore this because this is, I think, really the key to\nit, right? Suppose that instead of filing a single document called the\nnotice of appeal, Mr. Parrish had filed a notice of appeal and stapled to\nthe front of it was a motion to reopen.\nIn that situation, if the district court had found that the criteria to open\nwere satisfied, are you saying that Mr. Parrish would have had to send in\na new notice of appeal?\n### Michael R. Huston:\nAs presently constituted, yes, because the rules are clear about that, but\n### Justice Jackson:\nThe one that the district court got to begin with would not be enough?\n### Michael R. Huston:\nYes.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBecause it was filed too early?\n### Michael R. Huston:\nPresently, because of the way the rule text is written.\nBut I think this is very important.\nAnd I think that perhaps the best thing that this Court could do in this\ncase would be to instruct the Rules Committee to adopt a new rule that\nwould look very much like that one.\nI do think that's consistent with the statutory text, and the reason why\nis this Court's decision in FirsTier.\nFirsTier explains that you cannot change the -- the jurisdictional period\nwhen a notice of appeal must be filed.\nThat's always jurisdictional.\nBut, importantly, the Rules Committee does have the power to enact\nrules that change how documents get filed.\nThe best example is Rule 4(c).\n### Justice Jackson:\nI guess what I don't understand is that if you can construe this very\ndocument as a motion to reopen for the purpose of all of the\njurisdictional consequences that you're describing, I don't understand\nwhy you can't also construe that very document as a timely filed notice\nof appeal?\n### Michael R. Huston:\nIt's because, Your Honor, this Court has said over and over again that the\nrule of liberal construction for pro se filers can accommodate looking at\nwhat --at the substance of a document and understanding it to be\nsomething else.\nBut, importantly, the court cannot reconstrue when something is filed.\nThat's the whole point of the Court's holding in Bowles, is that there are\nlimitations on the judicial discretion of -- of -- of construing\nsomething.\nAnd you can't just construe the thing to have been filed at a different\ntime.\nSo, in a situation where the rules describe when the document must be\nfiled for jurisdictional purposes, and 2107(c) is such an instruction, it\nmust actually be filed during that period.\nBut, again, consider the prison mailbox rule.\nThe prison mailbox rule, which we have no problem with, is a rule\nwhereby the Rules Committee has provided an opportunity for certain\nfilers to ensure that their filing gets made during the jurisdictional\nperiod.\nAnd I think actually, importantly, Rule 4(a)(2) also works this way.\nI would urge the Court to take a look at the way in which Rule 4(a)(2) is\nwritten. It's written awkwardly and very precisely.\nIt says that the document will become -- the notice of appeal will\nbecome effective on and after the relevant --the entry of the judgment\nthat authorizes the notice of appeal.\nIt's written that way, I think, precisely because the purpose of the rule is\nto transport the filing into the jurisdictional period.\nAnd we think that is within the Rules Committee' s power for the same\nreason why the prison mailbox rule is within the Rules Committee's\npower.\nBut we don't have any rule like that as we sit here today.\nPerhaps the Rules Committee should enact one.\nAnd I think that, as we've discussed this morning, there's every reason\nto think that the Rules Committee will carefully study this issue. And if\nthe rule that my friends advocate is a good one, they may well adopt a\nrule very much like the one that\n### Justice Jackson:\nhas suggested: file a\nmotion to reopen and attach a notice of appeal and then an instruction\nto the clerk to file that notice of appeal during the jurisdictional window.\nBut the Rules Committee, with all respect, is much better suited than\nthis Court to undertake the process of developing those rules -- this\nCourt, I mean, just acting by sort of one -off judicial decisions to -- to\ndeal with sympathetic litigants in individual situations.\nThe Committee undertakes, as the Court is aware, a complicated\nprocess of study. Congress has the opportunity to weigh in.\nWe're going to get a better -- a better overall rule if the Rules\nCommittee is allowed to do its work.",

And, as I\nmentioned, because the statutory text is --here is so clear, there's\nreally no corresponding situation where a petitioner makes a reasonable\nmistake about when the notice of appeal is supposed to be filed. The\nSolicitor General agrees that our understanding of that statutory text is\nclearly the best one.\nSo -- and that's -- that is what I take to be the core thrust of the Court's\nopinion in -- in FirsTier, and this Court's and Your Honor's opinion in\nOutlaw recognized that. It said, precisely because FirsTier recognized\nthat the principle, the common law principle, is more limited and has\nbeen codified in a more limited way, we, as judicial officers in individual\ncases, are not free to embrace a sort of universal ripening principle."
