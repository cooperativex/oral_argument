  "background": "In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) strengthened its national air quality standards for ozone, requiring states to submit implementation plans that would prevent their emissions from significantly impacting other states’ air quality. In February 2023, the EPA issued a final rule disapproving the plans submitted by 21 states, including Oklahoma and Utah, after evaluating them using a four-step framework designed to address interstate pollution. Oklahoma and Utah, along with various industry groups, challenged the EPA’s disapproval of their plans in their respective regional circuit courts. The EPA responded by moving to transfer these cases to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, arguing that because the disapprovals were published together in a single Federal Register notice and used a consistent analytical approach, they must be reviewed by the D.C. Circuit rather than regional courts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit agreed with the EPA that the challenged rule is nationally applicable, so it granted the EPA’s motions to transfer the petitions to the D.C. Circuit.",

And if -- if you regard the\nno, you should probably disregard it.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAre they materially different? If what the EPA did here was separate out\nI see one -- one publication that lists each state separately and has the\nanalysis for each state separately.\nIf EPA put a page break between each one of the states and published\nthem differently, would you say that's a sentence 2 scenario?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nI -- I don't think a page break would be enough, but if EPA issued\ndifferent -- you know, 21 different Federal Register notices on 21\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nWith the same kind of content as to the nationwide part of it, and then\neach one with a different analysis, how does this content, the\nnationwide content apply to the particular state involved, then we\nwould say that's a series of discrete state-specific actions.\nAnd in -- in a way the most straightforward way for us to prevail in this\ncase ultimately is on prong 3, because the analysis under prong 3\ndoesn't depend on what if any weight the court gives to EPA's decision\nto issue these, all of these in one Federal Register notice.\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo on the thought, the prong 3 determination, what --what is your view\nas to why this is still driven? I understand that you have four factors and\nyou're applying the four factors.\nAnd we would hope that that would be the case, that you would be\nassessing each state consistently using a set of criteria.\nBut I take your point that that's enough to make it a --a determination\nof national scope or application?\n### Malcolm L. Stewart:\nWell, I mean, it is partly that they were the four criteria we were going to\nuse.\nIt was partly that they at least to a degree were new and contested.\nWe anticipated from comments we received on the proposed\ndisapprovals that the states would contest the methodology, not just its\napplication.\nThe other thing I would say is all of the states whose plans were\ndisapproved had proposed to take no further ameliorative action with\nrespect to ozone transport beyond what they were already doing.\nSo it would have been a much more complicated analysis if various\nstates had been planning to improve their plans in -- in different ways\nand EPA was required to make state-by-state determinations as to is\nthis good enough.\nIn -- instead, we had -- we approved a lot of plans that -- for states\nthat fell below the 1 percent threshold, disapproved a lot of plans for\nstates that in our view fell above it and that didn't propose to do\nanything additional.",

Stewart:\nThank you.\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nMr. Mansinghani.\n### Mithun Mansinghani:\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nTwo quick points.\nTo Justice Kagan's question about whether the four determinations\nwere sort of the be all/end all here, and it seems like Mr. Stewart seemed\nto think so with the 1 percent threshold, if you look at Oklahoma's plan,\nOklahoma said, look, even --even though we're above the screening\nthreshold, here's why our contributions are not significantly going to\ncontribute to non-attainment down-wind.\nLook at the trends in Oklahoma's emissions due to the specific structure\nof the Southern Power Pool and to how Oklahoma operates its electric\ngenerating fleet.\nAnd look at the dropping ozone levels in down-wind states like Texas,\nbecause of mobile source changes.\nEPA rejected those rationales, but nonetheless those were state-\nspecific things that ended up controlling the decision.\nSimilarly with Utah, Utah said based on a weight -- weight-of-the-\nevidence analysis, we don't think we're significantly contributing\nbecause in the west, as EPA had prior determined with states like\nArizona and California, the -- the relative contributions are relatively\nlow. Around 6 to 7 percent are coming from other states, very different\nfrom what's happening in the east.\nSo these were all very state-specific things that EPA had to -- to\nadjudicate, even after it got past all of those four determinations.\nThe second thing I wanted to talk about was where we are with the text\nof the exception.\nYou know, Mr. Stewart's test has a lot of atextual things to it.\nWell, it has to be a determination but a new one, not a -- not an old one.\nWe have to try to figure out where -- what -- what part of the action\nlitigants are likely to challenge.\nAre they likely to challenge the local aspects or the national aspects?\nThat --that seems like a very hard-to-adjudicate venue test.\nAnd it's also something that doesn't come from anywhere in the\nstatute.\nI think our test comes from the words \"based on,\" which in this Court's\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act decision in Sachs, I think takes a\nsimilar approach as we do.\nIt has to be the gravamen -- gravamen or foundation of the action and\nnot just an element.\nAnd in that case, this Court declined to apply the commercial activities\nexception in a unanimous decision, even though plaintiffs had alleged\ncommercial activities, because the Court said that alleging all of those\nthings alone still entitled plaintiffs to nothing.\nBut then you also couple that with the fact that I think the third\nsentence has to be read in conjunction with the first two.\nIt has to be things like are in the first sentence, like the setting of a\nnational uniform air quality standard or a national uniform standard of\nperformance for sources.\nCouple that with the types of cases that we talked about like the NRDC\ncases and Dayton Power cases and the fact that this is a venue clause, so\nit shouldn't be manipulable, and the fact that it's an exception, so it\nshouldn't be read to swallow the rule.\nI think all of that leads to -- to our test.\n\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you, counsel.\nThe case is submitted.",
