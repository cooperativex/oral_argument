  "background": "On April 28, 2016, Officer Roberto Felix Jr. fatally shot Ashtian Barnes during a traffic stop on the Harris County Tollway. After spotting Barnes’s Toyota Corolla, which had been flagged for toll violations, Felix initiated a stop and Barnes pulled over to the median. When Felix requested documentation, Barnes, who was driving a car rented in his girlfriend’s name, could not produce it and began “digging around” in the car. Claiming he smelled marijuana, Felix questioned Barnes, who then turned off the vehicle and suggested checking the trunk for documentation. Dash cam footage shows that after Barnes opened the trunk and exited the vehicle at Felix’s request, the car’s blinker came back on and the vehicle began to move. Felix, with his weapon drawn, stepped onto the moving car and pressed his gun against Barnes’s head. While holding onto the car frame with his head above the roof—leaving him unable to see inside the vehicle—Felix fired two shots. Barnes’s vehicle stopped, and he was pronounced dead at the scene at 2:57 p.m. Though both the Houston Police Department and Harris County Precinct 5 Constable's Office investigated the incident, a grand jury found no probable cause for an indictment. \n The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, focusing exclusively on the two seconds before the shooting when Barnes’s car began moving with Felix holding onto it. The court ruled that because Felix reasonably feared for his life in that moment, his use of deadly force was justified regardless of his previous actions, such as jumping onto the moving vehicle. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.",

Zelinsky:\nIt's the same thing\n### Justice Alito:\nThe reason for the question is to probe whether you are using the term\n\"unreasonable\" in a sense that's different from the sense in which the\nFourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. So\n\"unreasonable\" has a particular meaning when the Court has to decide\nwhether there was a Fourth Amendment violation.\nBut, in lay speech, \"unreasonable\" could go to whether the action was\nprudent, whether it was a violation of best police practices or the\npractices of a particular police department.\nThose are not necessarily the same thing.\nIn fact, it seems that they're probably different.\nSo you are eliding these two different meanings of \"reasonable.\" Now\nmaybe that's -- maybe that's sound.\nMaybe that's unsound.\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nJustice Alito, what we're asking for is the standard that this Court has\napplied in Garner, Graham, and Scott and Plumhoff, which is you have to\nlook at the -- the balance here.\nThere's, on the one side, the state interest in seizing someone in a\nparticular manner.\nOn the other side, there is the harm to the suspect, here, the ultimate\nharm, the loss of his life. The problem in this case is that the Fifth Circuit\ncouldn't engage in that core balancing because it couldn't ask was there\na really pressing reason for an officer to jump onto a car and give himself\nno other opportunity but to shoot the driver.\n### Justice Alito:\nit is wrong for a court to look just at the moment of the threat, that the\ncourt has to judge the reasonableness of the alleged unreasonable\nseizure based on -- taking into account to whatever extent they are\nrelevant the events that occurred before that? Would you be satisfied if\n### Nathaniel A.G. Zelinsky:\nOne hundred percent.\nI think it would be helpful if the Court makes clear that that means that\nyou can look at the jump in addition to the shoot, right?

Or are you asking the court or the jury\nto determine whether the whole course of conduct in which the officer is\nengaged was unreasonable, in part in the sense that it wasn't prudent, it\nwas in violation of perhaps departmental policies or the best practices\nthat had been established for police department -- that --that some\npeople think should be followed by police departments around the\ncountry? That -- that's really the difficult question, and what -- what\nwould you say to that?\n### Zoe A. Jacoby:\nI would say, Justice Alito, the former.\nThe question is: Was the use of force, the seizure, reasonable in the\nmoment? That's what we're trying to get at when we look at the totality\nof circumstances.\nWe're not doing some sort of freewheeling inquiry into whether the\nofficer overall, over the course of five minutes, acted reasonably.\nSo -- so that is why we think the circumstances in the moment do have\nprime importance.\nBut that does not mean that courts have a license to ignore everything\nbefore that moment, as the Fifth Circuit did here.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, would it be -- would a court hearing this case be obligated to\nadmit expert testimony by various individuals who have a view about\nwhat are good police practices and what are not good police practices?\nWould the -- would that be what the jury's determination would boil\ndown to?\n### Zoe A. Jacoby:\nSo the ultimate determination here about whether the officer acted\nreasonably is, according to Scott, a pure question of law.\nThe jury's not deciding that.\nThe jury could be making factual determinations about what actually\nhappened, you know, when the officer jumped and -- and all the rest.\nAs the Court is examining whether that initial thing that the officer did\nhere, jumping on the car, was outside the bounds of reasonable\nbehavior, I do think it's appropriate to look at training manuals and the\nlike.\nThat can't resolve the question, but that could provide helpful\nguidance.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, there are federal -- there are some federal law enforcement\nofficers who make vehicle stops.\nSo what is the -- the teaching? Do you know? What --what are they\ntaught about placing themselves in front of the car or in a position\nwhere they could be killed or injured if the driver decides to try to drive\naway?\n### Zoe A. Jacoby:\nI don't know across the board a rule for stepping in front of cars.\nI know that federal officers are trained to use force to respond to danger\nbut not to enter into situations where the use of force becomes sort of\ninevitable.\nThat's like the DHS manual that my friend points to at page 41 of her\nbrief.\nI think, again, we don't really train officers to go right up to the\nconstitutional line.\nWe often will train officers to not enter in these situations to begin with\neven if -- if they ultimately do so, it could end up being not a Fourth\nAmendment violation.\nSo I suspect we would train officers not to -- you know, to frequently\navoid using force on roads and whatnot, even if it would be permissible\nunder the circumstances to do so, because we just want to -- to train\nthem more cautiously, I suspect.\n### Justice Alito:\nThank you.",
