  "background": "In 2012, Danny Rivers was convicted in Texas state court of multiple charges related to sexual abuse of a child and possession of child pornography. He filed his first federal habeas petition in August 2017 challenging these convictions, which was denied by the district court in September 2018. While his appeal of that denial was pending, Rivers filed a second habeas petition in February 2021 raising new claims after obtaining his attorney-client file through a state bar grievance in October 2019. The district court deemed this second petition “successive” under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”) and transferred it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for authorization, but Rivers failed to file the required motion for authorization. After the Fifth Circuit ultimately affirmed the denial of his first petition in May 2022, Rivers appealed the transfer order of his second petition, arguing that it should have been treated as a motion to amend his first petition rather than as a successive petition since his first petition was still pending when he filed the second one. The Fifth Circuit disagreed and affirmed the district court’s dismissal of Rivers’s second-in-time petition for lack of jurisdiction.",

Bruland:\nPost-AEDPA, I would say the second or successive petition is something\nthat, in 1996, when Congress used that phrase, ordinary members of\nthe bar would have recognized as settled is second or successive. And\nAEDPA says we look at the purpose behind -- I'm sorry, Banister says we\nlook at the purposes behind the statute, judicial economy, piecemeal\nlitigation, hastening finality.\nAnd Banister tells us that that's how you look at it.\nAnd this case, I think, is easier than Banister or Gonzalez because the\nstatute itself answers that.\nHere we have Congress specifically considering how amendments\nshould work in habeas, and Congress says amendments in habeas work\njust like amendments in ordinary civil litigation.\nAnd Congress said that there's a small sliver of amendments that are\nsubject to the second or successive rules and only those.\n### Justice Thomas:\nAnd don't we normally --in the mine-run cases consider second -in-\ntime to be \"second and successive\"?\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nSo, Justice Thomas, if I were just looking at the phrase, I would say yes,\nthat's how I would look at \"second or successive.\" But this Court has\nsaid \"second or successive\" is a term of art.\nAnd so all I'm saying today is what this Court said in Banister, which is\nthat we look at the history and the purposes.\nAnd, again, I think this case is easier than Banister because we have a\nstatutory hook.\nAnd going to that statutory hook, 2242 gives us the general rule.\nAnd then 2266(b)(3)(B) gives us the only exception. Congress\nspecifically thought about which amendments should be subject to the\nrules governing second or successive petitions, and it said in 2266(b)(3)\n(B), it's only this tiny sliver, filed by prisoners on death row in opt-in\nstates after the state files its answer.

      "dialogue": "Justice Jackson\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd he had a judgment.\nI guess what I'm trying to understand -- so, first of all, is your primary\nargument that after judgment against him on the habeas claim that\nexisted, he appeals it, and during the pendency of an appeal, if he seeks\nto amend the existing habeas claim, you say what? Because the appeal is\nstill pending, he can do it?\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nNot necessarily,\n### Justice Jackson:\n.\nBecause the appeal is still pending, it's not second or successive.\nIt might be a bad amendment.\nIt might die for Rule 15 reasons.\nHow do you square that with Gonzalez and the idea that the judgment is\ndoing some work here?\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nSo, Justice Jackson, Gonzalez did not face the question presented here,\nbecause there was no pending appeal in Gonzalez.\nThe --really, Gonzalez comes in a year after abandoning his appeal,\nwhen all of us up here agree that a habeas claim in that posture would be\nsecond or successive. And so, in Gonzalez, anything that comes in would\nbe second or successive.\nAnd that's why the Court is saying, well, you can't come in and\ncircumvent the statute.\n### Justice Jackson:\nWell, why wouldn't you be circumventing the statute here by just, you\nknow, interpreting anything that comes in during an appeal as not\nbeing second or successive?\n### Justice Jackson:\nI mean, we have a statute in which Congress was very clear about\nlimiting the number of filings or at least applying pretty restrictive rules\nto the ability to file another application.\nAnd so I guess what I --it --it boils down to for me at least is trying to\nunderstand the work of the judgment in providing the dividing line as to\nwhether things filed after that -- assuming the judgment remains in\neffect, are -- are --why aren't they second or successive and wouldn't\nyou be undermining AEDPA to say otherwise?\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nSo two responses,\n### Justice Jackson:\n.\nFirst, if you assume that what Rivers filed was second or successive and\nwere just trying to circumvent the statute, then I lose.\nBut that's not how Banister looked at it.\nBanister said we have a statutory phrase, \"second or successive\" habeas\ncorpus application, that event meant something in 1996 when Congress\nenacted the statute.\nAnd the way we figure out what it meant is we look at pre-AEDPA\nhistory and practice and doctrine and AEDPA's purposes.\nSo going squarely to your question, my point is that, leading up to\nAEDPA, a filing that came in during the appeal might have lost on the\nmerits.\nBanister says, well, that doesn't count for the analysis.\nI understand.\nBut -- aren't you reading a lot into Banister? I mean, wasn't that in a\n59(e) scenario?\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd didn't that have something to do with the analysis? I mean, the\npoint there was that the judgment was suspended, such that -- you\nknow, it's very -- a limited amount of time, and it wasn't really the\nappeal or lack of an appeal or whatnot that seemed to be doing the\nwork.\nIt was about the nature of the judgment under a 59(e) scenario.\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nSo, Justice Jackson, I agree that Banister was focused on that question,\nand Banister wasn't focused on the question before you today, the\nquestion of well, what do we do when new evidence arises on the\nappeal? My point is that Banister gives us the logic that we're supposed\nto use in analyzing, well, how do we treat a claim or a filing that's not a\n59(e).\nAnd what I would say is Banister says look to the history, look to the\npurposes. And here I think we have history in droves.\nWe give you the Harisiades case, the Strand case out of the Tenth Circuit,\nall of these other cases where prisoners leading up to AEDPA lob in",

      "dialogue": "Justice Sotomayor\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSorry.\nI'm -- I'm not sure I follow your argument.\nIf it's normal civil litigation and not habeas, if you file a motion to\namend between a final judgment in the district court and an appeal, the\ndistrict court has no inherent power to open -- to grant that motion,\ncorrect?\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nCorrect.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll it could do is a 62.1, make a suggestion to the court of appeals,\ncorrect?\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nYes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nHere you didn't ask them to make a suggestion.\nSo not having asked them to do it, why do you think the motion is still\nalive after the court of appeals affirmed the judgment below?\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nWell, two responses,\n### Justice Sotomayor:\n.\nHow could the court -- the district court reopen absent 60(b)? That's\nmy point.\nYou could reopen under -- you could reopen under 60(b) to consider\nyour motion, correct?\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nCorrect.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\nBut none of that happened.\nYou didn't ask them to indicate under 62.1 and the court of appeals\ndidn't vacate or remand the matter to the district court to make the\nmotion to amend still live, right?\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nSo I -- I agree with you on the second half,\n### Justice Sotomayor:\n.\nI disagree about what the record shows on the first half.\nIf you look at Joint Appendix 107, Rivers is asking, he says, look, please,\ndistrict court, would you consider an interlocutory review.\nHe can't do a -- that's the point.\nIt may have been a product of him being pro se.\nAnd if he had hired you then, you probably would have made a motion -\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nWell, my point is --is twofold.\nFirst, I think he did ask for an interlocutory review.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThere is no interlocutory relief, meaning you admitted that the district\ncourt does not have the power to adjudicate the motion to amend.\nThe most it could do is what 62.1 permits, which is an indication to the\ncourt of appeals.\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nYes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd that's not an interlocutory appeal.\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nSo I take what he was asking for.\nThe only plausible way to construe what he was asking for is as an\nindicative ruling.\nNow, the district court took up his motion to amend and didn't reach\nthe merits.\nIt said: Look, I don't have the jurisdiction to open the front cover\nbecause this is a second or successive petition.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThat's correct.\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nSo we're asking you to hold that that was a mistake under AEDPA.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nBut he -- he presented the same thing to the court of appeals, basically\nthe same motion, and the court of appeals did not grant a vacate and\nremand.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nIt wasn't convinced by whatever he presented.\nIt may have made an error, but that wasn't appealed either.\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nSo, Justice Sotomayor, I don't think the court of appeals saying we're\nnot going to enlarge the record shows us what it would do in response to\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nIt could have done -- it could have done what we did in the case you cite.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nIf there had been a confession of error or if it was convinced that\nsomething truly untoward had happened, it could have vacated and\nremanded.\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nWell, Justice Sotomayor, I think there's a meaningful difference\nbetween a prisoner mailing in some typewritten pages and one of the\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nIn civil litigation, absent a vacate and remand by the court of appeals,\nwould the motion have to be considered under 60(b)?\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nIf there's no indicative ruling and if there's no vacatur and remand, then\nthe only way to reopen the judgment would be 60(b), unless the court of\nappeals reverses or vacates otherwise.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nCorrect.\nThank you.",

Bruland:\nYes, that's right.\n### Justice Jackson:\nJust have the opportunity to do it?\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nThat's right.\nIt's a question about the district court's power. Texas is coming in and\nsaying, well, look, there's nothing that you could on remand.\nAnd we've identified a procedure that would let the district court grant\nRivers redress.\n### Justice Jackson:\nWhat about the habeas jurisdiction and the fact that he's in custody on\none charge versus the other?\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nYes.\nWe're challenging the convictions for which he's still in custody. I don't\ntake the other side to be arguing that the new exculpatory evidence\ndoesn't undermine those convictions.\nThey certainly didn't argue that in the brief in opposition or below.\nI take them to be challenging us on the merits, but I don't take them to\nthe evidence wouldn't go as a jurisdictional matter.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThank you.\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nNow, my --my friends on the other side, I think, are going to stand up\nand say a word about the floodgates.\nAnd so I do want to address that.\nAnd the reason that our approach doesn't open the floodgates is that it\ncomes with a structural barrier and an absolute jurisdictional backstop.\nAnd that's borne out by what we've seen in the Second Circuit over the\nlast two decades.\nSo I'll start with the structural piece.\nFor any of this to get off the ground, the habeas petitioner has to go to\nthe district court, convince the district court to issue an inter- -- an\nindicative ruling on a habeas petition that it's just denied.\nAnd then the absolute jurisdictional backstop is the court of appeals has\nto agree to remand the case for further proceedings.\nAnd at both steps of those analysis, the prisoner has the burden of\nshowing that amendment here would not be futile, that it's timely.\nThat kicks out a lot of cases because AEDPA has a one-year statute of\nlimitations. The prisoner is also going to have to show that it's not going\nto be a dead case on the merits.\nThen you go up to the court of appeals.\nAnd we've --we've cited cases.\nThe Louisiana against Becerra case, where the Western District of\nLouisiana sent up a flare to the Fifth Circuit, and the Fifth Circuit said,\nno, we -- we don't think this amendment should go forward.\nIt's not timely.\nYou should have brought it earlier.\nSo the court of appeals is doing another review.\nAnd all of this is borne out by what we've seen in the Second Circuit over\nthe last 20 years because the Second Circuit has read AEDPA our way.\nThey've said 2244 doesn't kick in until the end of the appeal.\nAnd I will tell you I've read more of these cases than I care to remember.\nThere's about one or two per year over the last 20 years.\nAnd what you see, time and time again, is prisoners come in and they\nsay, look, I just got some new evidence, or something changed and I\nwant to fight it out.\nAnd in one-or two-or three-page opinions, a magistrate judge or the\ndistrict court judge has no trouble addressing those claims.\nAnd just to take a step back, at bottom, I think this case is really a venue\ncase, like the EPA cases you had last week because, these claims are\ncoming in one way or the other.\nThe question is just who's the frontline decisionmaker going to be.\nI can tell you when a prisoner gets new evidence or thinks the prisoner\nhas a new claim while the appeal is pending, he's going to send\nsomething in to some court.\nAnd then some decisionmaker is going to have to decide, well, what do I",

Bruland:\nThat's right, Justice Sotomayor.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo the Third Circuit, I don't think, is inconsistent with anything.\nThe Second Circuit does have some very charitably loose language that -\n- that a motion to amend is never second or successive.\nBut I, like you, had my law clerk look at what the Second Circuit was\ndoing, and I got a bunch of cases where the district court didn't wait for\nthe court of appeals to rule but instead said it was an abuse of -- that\nthe motion to amend was an abuse of the writ.\nSo I don't know -- and they dismissed and the circuit didn't do\nanything.\nSo I'm not sure the rule is as absolute as you say.\nThey're basically following and saying hold it until the circuit acts.\nAnd if we vacate and remand, then you can consider it.\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nI think that's right,\n### Justice Sotomayor:\n.\nHere's how I understand it. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1, it\nsays the district court can always consider something that comes in.\nAnd the district court has three options.\nIt can deny it outright.\nI think that's most of the cases that you and I were discussing.\nIt can also defer ruling.\nI think that's one of the things that the Third Circuit was focused on.\nI think your opinion in the Ching case has the footnote that says the\nsame thing.\nOr -- and this is the -- the other alternative we were talking about -- it\ncan send up a flare to the court of appeals and say this raises a\nsubstantial issue.\nSo you're suggesting sort of a, what should I call it, procedural thing?\nDon't call it second or successive and refer to the court of appeals, but\ninstead deny it now?\n### Peter A. Bruland:\nJustice Sotomayor, I want to be very clear about the doctrine because\nthere are two separate questions.\nThere's the question of is it second or successive as Congress used that\nphrase in 1996? And then there is an analytically distinct question of\nwhat should you do with it procedurally.\nMy -- the only question I'm asking you to answer is what is the meaning\nof \"second or successive\" habeas corpus application in 1996? And then\nwe've also tried to give you some comfort about the procedural\npathway.\nAnd so, yes, that is one of the things that a district court can do.\nAnd, in fact, that's what most of the courts in the Second Circuit that\nwe've seen have done, is just take one look, deny them outright.\nAnd the last thing I would add is the other side comes in and says: Well,\nhow does that square with your efficiency argument, if the prisoner can\njust file something in the middle of the appeal and then file a second or\nsuccessive petition? I didn't find a single case in the Second Circuit\nwhere that happened.\nPrisoners are taking no for an answer.\nAnd if they didn't, boy, if I were a court of appeals judge, I would be glad\nto have a short opinion explaining why this amendment goes nowhere.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThank you.",

It seems like it's worked fine.\n### Aaron L. Nielson:\nWell, I --we --we don't think it's worked fine.\nThe case that we cite was the Anderson case out of Connecticut, where,\nyou know, it seemed like a pretty straightforward issue.\nThe poor judge has to go through three separate lines of analysis to try\nto figure out what to do with this thing.\nAnd that's, I think, a pretty straightforward case. But I would also, you\nknow, recognize that, by definition, you're going to have multiple\nappeals possible out of -- out of a single case.\nSo you have the very first one that is up on appeal.\nWhile that's happening, all the way up to this Court, up in certiorari\npetition, they file a second one.\nThey ca n keep litigating that.\nWell, that means you're going to get two appeals out of a single -- what\nthey claim is a single application.\nThat doesn't make any sense.\nAnd I think it's important to recognize that 2244(b) doesn't mean you\nlose. 2244(b) means you have to go to the court of appeals.\nAnd we're talking about mid-appeal cases.\nSo that means, you know, unless it's, like, day 29, so we're not just past\nRule 59(e) -- 59(b) --59(e), rather, we're talking about a case where\nyou already have a court of appeals panel who is already looking at this\nthing.\nIt seems to me a lot more efficient for that panel to be able to have the\nopportunity to look at the new material, rather than sending it back to a\ndistrict court or a magistrate judge three years ago, you know, 1500\ncases later.\nThey're not going to possibly remember what that case was about,\nwhereas you have a panel looking at it right now.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nIf we -- if we conclude the pre -'96 case law is just a mixed bag, doesn't\n### Aaron L. Nielson:\nWell, I mean, I would urge --I think the Court already answered the\nhistory, in both Gonzalez and Bannister.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nOn -- on -- on this issue.\n### Aaron L. Nielson:\nSure.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nOkay.\n### Aaron L. Nielson:\nI think the Court has already answered the history in Gonzalez and\nBanister.\nBecause in every Circuit Court, if you file a motion to amend a case that\nhas been closed for years, it's either one of two things: It's either a\nnullity, does not exist, or it will be construed as a Rule 60(b) motion.\nThat is the rule in Moore's Federal Practice. We can cite other cases as\nwell, we have a whole string cite of these cases.\nWhat we know from Gonzalez and Banister, that if it's a Rule 60(b), well,\nthen it's already second --second and successive. So I don't think the\nhistory works for them.\nThey do have a couple of cases where they say, well, that looks like\namendment, but they didn't grant relief in any of those cases. We're\nreading a lot into silence, especially because we have cases like Judge\nArnold's decision from the Eighth Circuit.\nYou know, he knows a little thing about civil procedure, and he says no,\nyou can't -- you can't do this.\nI think that would be the relevant history.\nSo you have all the cases that say 60(b) mid-appeal, that counts as\nsecond or successive, and you have someone who tries to get around\nthat with Rule 15, and they say, well, that's second and successive too.\nThat's the history in 19 -- leading up right to 1996.

I think it did for the textual reasons, the historical reasons, the\npurposive reasons.\nAnd if that's right, then I think the correct remedy would be to reverse\nand to send it back down.\nAnd what we would say then is we could have the debate about, well,\nmaybe they would say harmless error because they don't like the\nprocedures or they have merits arguments, but we would be asking you\nto correct the threshold jurisdictional error that they made about the\nmeaning of 2244(b).\nThat was what cut everything off. Now, I don't think there's any\ndaylight between what I'm asking you to do and what the Third Circuit\nand even the Second Circuit have said.\nIt all goes to what Mr. Guarnieri just said about, well, for some other\nreason.\nAnd I don't understand where that's coming from, because 2106\ndoesn't say \"for some other reason.\" And I don't see there being any\nsort of penumbral emanations from Rule 60(b) that curtail the\nappellate court's power to vacate.\nSo then the question becomes, well, where are we getting this you can't\nask the district court to send up a flare so that the court of appeals can\nvacate just because you want to amend.\nIt seems like what they're asking to you do is put an atextual gloss on\n2106 such that if you're asking for a certain form of relief, then that\ndoesn't fly.\nI'm not sure where that comes from, but it certainly doesn't come from\nAEDPA.\nAnd this Court could reverse just saying the meaning of 2244(b) is not\nwhat the lower court said. And you could save all of this stuff about the\nprocedures and 2106 for another day. We're just asking you to reverse\non the threshold AEDPA ground, which is analytically distinct from the\nprocedural pathway.\nJustice Alito, I want to take just one more crack at addressing your\nconcerns about the QP.\nWhat I would say is the amendment argument is a narrower ground that\nanswers directly the QP.\nWe framed it broadly.\nWe said does 2244 apply to all, some, or no mid-appeal habeas filings?\nThe amendment argument says, well, it sure doesn't apply to all\nbecause textually, historically, and looking at AEDPA's purposes, an\namendment is not a second or successive petition.\nI could understand the other side's argument, if I were coming up here\nasking you to accept something broader, but usually as an advocate, it's\na good thing to be standing up here offering a narrow ground for relief\nwith a statutory hook.\nJustice Kavanaugh, I want to say a few words to you about workability\nbecause I think that is the key or a key point in this case.\nIt really does come down to what is the proper venue because a prisoner\nwho gets new evidence is going to race to court no matter what decision\nthis Court reaches today.\nAnd then some district court or some court of appeals is going to have to\ndecide what to do.\nBut please don't take my word for it. Don't take General Nielson's word\nfor it.\nI urge to you look at the judge's amicus brief, because you have 17 of\nyour former Article III colleagues with nearly 300 years -- or 300 years\nof experience collectively as appellate judges and district court judges\nand magistrate judges and what they're in here telling you is the other\nside's rule is burdensome for the judicial system as a whole.\nThat's because the court of appeals is going to happen -- have to open a\nbrand new original proceeding every time one of these claims comes\nthrough the door.\nAnd, remember, these claims are coming whatever this Court says.\nSo I think it's a whole lot more efficient looking at AEDPA's purposes to\nchannel these things through the district court, the single\ndecisionmaker most familiar with the case, which as Banister said and\nMagwood said, the district court can take a five-minute glance at this\nand say, no, it loses on the merits, so no need to bother the court of\nappeals.\nThese claims are coming.\nAnd the most workable solution is to say they get channeled through\nthe district court while the appeal is pending.\nI will be the first to grant Congress inverted the normal presumption\nthat appellate courts are courts of review, not first view, once the first\ncase is over.\nBut while the first case is still pending, 2244 does not apply.\nAnd it does not flip that presumption.\nAnd I think the judges well explain why there's no evidence that's what\nCongress intended.\nAgain, the last thing I'll say and then I'll sit down early, we are just\nasking you to reverse the lower court's threshold error about the\nmeaning of 2244, and then we can fight out whether Danny Rivers has\nmerits issues or procedural issues.\nBottom line, Danny Rivers might have 99 problems; it's just 2244 isn't\none of them. We would ask you to reverse.\nThank you.",
