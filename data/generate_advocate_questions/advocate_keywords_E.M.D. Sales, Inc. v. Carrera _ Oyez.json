  "background": "E.M.D. Sales Inc. (EMD) is a distributor of Latin American, Caribbean, and Asian food products to grocery stores in the Washington, D.C. area. Three of EMD’s sales representatives—Faustino Sanchez Carrera, Magdaleno Gervacio, and Jesus David Muro—sued EMD and its CEO, Elda Devarie, in 2017 for allegedly violating the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by denying them overtime wages. The plaintiffs claimed they worked about 60 hours per week, paid on commission without overtime compensation. The sales representatives were assigned routes of stores, spending most of their time servicing chain stores and some independent groceries. Their duties included restocking shelves, managing inventory, and submitting orders for EMD products. While they could make some sales to independent stores, their ability to make sales at chain stores was limited, as high-level negotiations between EMD management and corporate buyers typically determined product placement. EMD argued that the sales representatives were exempt from overtime pay under the FLSA’s “outside sales” exemption. The case went to a bench trial, where the court had to determine whether the plaintiffs’ primary duty was making sales, qualifying them for the exemption, or if their work was primarily incidental to sales made by others. The district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, finding that EMD failed to prove the outside sales exemption applied, awarded both unpaid overtime wages and liquidated damages, but limited the damages to a two-year period after concluding that EMD's violation was not willful. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.",

You asked us to vacate and remand.\nThe SG wants us to reverse, which usually suggests to me that they\nthink the judgment below can't be sustained under any reading.\nAnd the other side says, regardless of the standard, affirm.\nOur practice is to remand.\nBut what outcome could a different standard of proof have on the\nfactual findings in this case?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nSo let me address just sort of the -- I don't think at least we intended\nany difference between vacatur and reversal.\nWe just copied what the Court did in the Starbucks case because it\ninvolved a similar misapplication, so we just took identically what you\nsaid in your opinion.\nI don't think the government's --I think the government and -- and we\nboth just think send it back.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWell, I don't disagree just for a moment.\nI do think the other side says this was harmless error.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nOf course.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right? So I don't think we should get into that.\nThe court below should.\nBut I'm asking you, why isn't it harmless error?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nRight, yeah.\nSo we think the ultimate --we think there's more than ample evidence\nfor the Court to find and will find below by a preponderance of the\nevidence.\nAnd the main reason -- and the regulation is cited at page 43A of the\nthis is an outside salesman -- it's not the time spent, but it's the most\nimportant, i.e., the character and time spent is one factor but not\ndispositive.\nAnd the four things that we would point to --and I think, again, the\nevidence is -- is great for us -- one, it's the testimony of the CEO, which\nis that just when she started the business, your job is to make sales.\nIt's to push that inventory and to increase the product.\nAnd, second, there were three salesmen that said that the sky was the\nlimit for them and their ability to make sales at chain stores and they\nlost track.\nThird, there was testimony of the Walmart former buyer for sauces and\ndressings and either he or she --I can't remember -- said that\nplanograms, which are basically your floor plans for your inventory\nshelf, that those were honored in the breach.\nIt's true that the Safeway and Giant people said we can't control where\nwe put the food, but the Walmart person said: Listen, sometimes we let\nthem, you know, sell us more tortillas or whatever they were selling and\nget more space.\nAnd finally, and the fourth one, and I think it is important at least to our\nclient in terms of common sense, they are called sales representatives,\nand the collective bargaining unit designated them as such, and nobody\ncomplained about overtime.\nSo this was a, you know, longstanding provision in the -- in --in the\nCBA.\nSo I think all of those things would lead to a sufficient basis.\nAnd the only way this Court could find harmless error, of course, would\nbe to find that no reasonable fact finder could find by a preponderance\nof the evidence.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nOn the last issue you raised, which was the collective bargaining issue,\nthis right of o vertime is not waivable by an employee, correct?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nCorrect, prospectively, yes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nBut you're not using it in that sense.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nNo, not at all.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nYou're using it in the sense of what they perceived as the most\nimportant part of their function?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nAbsolutely correct, that it was just the union, you know --and they were\npaid on a commission basis.\nIt necessarily wasn't based on new sales.\nSo this is more completely atmospherically inconsistent with their title,\nnot in any way -- not in any way binding.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThank you.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Jackson\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut what do we do about the fact that the money damages here are\nactually, I thought, doing more significant work than just providing\ndamages in that particular scenario? So, I mean, when Congress enacted\nthe FSLA --the FLSA, they talked about the fact that there were\ninterests at stake that were beyond money damages, that setting up the\nstatute in the way that they did ensured that businesses don't gain a\ncompetitive advantage by misclassifying employees.\nIt protects certain groups from substandard wages and thereby\nprotecting health and well -being. There was also the notion of\nspreading employment through the application of this law. So isn't this\nmore than just money damages? I mean, I take your point that it might\nnot be denaturalization, but I would think the government would say\nthe interests go beyond just pure money damages.\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nCertainly, we recognize there are very important policy interests at\nstake in this case and in the FLSA and that Congress legislated with\nthose in mind.\nI think the same thing is true for Title VII.\nIt's not just about the individual employee who's seeking damages.\nIt's about the broader interest in eradicating discrimination from the\nworkplace.\nCongress often makes these policy findings in its statutes where it lays\nout all of the interests that are at stake here, an d those can be\naddressed through a variety of means, for example, through this\nwaivability issue or waivability aspect of the statute where it can't be\nwaived.\nAnd so that is how some of those policy concerns are addressed.\nBut the heightened standard of proof has just never been used as the\nkind of tool that would -- that would be addressed in those kinds of\ninstances. Otherwise, I think it would -- it would risk making that\nstandard no longer -- the preponderance of the evidence may no longer\nbe the default standard in those cases because those kinds of interests\nare --are very frequently at stake when Congress is legislating.\nI -- I wanted to just make a couple -- a couple of points if there are no\nfurther questions on --on that.\nThe Respondents have -- have asserted the variety of reasons to depart\nfrom the default here, and the Court has never accepted those kinds of\nreasons in cases dealing with conventional remedies.\nAnd I think it's important here to note that no court has actually\naccepted them because the Fourth Circuit here, as Ms. Blatt already\ndiscussed, did not actually come up with any reasoned basi s for the\ndecision.\nIt -- it misconstrued this earlier precedent, but it never tried to\nreconcile the heightened standard of proof with the Court's precedents\nhere and with the -- the very narrow set of circumstances in which the\nCourt has suggested that it would be appropriate.\nSo the -- the reasons that Respondents have provided here are\ngenerally the policy interests in --in -- in overtime requirements,\nwhich, again, we agree are important, but other statutes also implicate\nvery important reasons. And, as this Court held in Grogan, I think the\nexemptions here are also a part of the congressional policy and are also a\npart of what Congress was doing when it was balancing the interests\nhere.\n### Justice Jackson:\nCan I ask you, is this the same standard of proof that would apply to the\ngovernment, the Department of Labor, if it is bringing suit to enforce\nthe FLSA?\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nYes, it's the same standard of proof.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd it's the same standard that the Department of Labor applies in its\nown administrative proceedings?\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nSo the Department of Labor does it -- the Department of Labor enforces\nthis statute through district court litigation.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThrough the courts.\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nSo it would always be the -- the same standard.\nOPM -- there are other administrative --OPM administers it for the\ngovernment on behalf of --of government employees, and those go\nthrough litigation as well and the same standard.\n### Justice Jackson:\nDoes the government have an idea of how often the standard of proof is\ndispositive in a case like this or any other?\n### Aimee W. Brown:\nIt's difficult to say.\nI mean, the amicus and --and the parties here have tried to kind of point\nto various cases where they think the standard may or may not have\nbeen dispositive.\nIn the Department of Labor's cases, its own litigation, where -- where\nwe might have more of an idea, the standard of proof I think is -- is\npretty rarely dispositive, but that's likely because most of the litigation\nin the context of the Department of Labor is about the interpretation of\nan exemption or, you know, whether an employer is -- an employee is -\n- is covered by the FLSA at all, whether they are an employee or an\nindependent contractor.\nSo, in those cases, in the cases that the Department has --has litigated,\nI don't think it often makes a huge difference, but it certainly can make\na difference in edge cases here, and I think that the Petitioners should\nbe given the opportunity to show that this is one of those cases.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd one final question --oh, sorry.",

Bateman:\nCertainly.\nI think Petitioners' methodology is inconsistent with the way this Court\nhas actually analyzed standards of proof issues, and I think the\nimmigration cases are a really great example.\nStarting in Schneiderman, this Court grappled with the standard of\nproof in denaturalization proceedings, and those proceedings took\na host of evidentiary directives, but it didn't contain a standard of proof.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut isn't that because they were sort of -- I think everyone concedes\nthat there's this kind of special category of cases that based on their\ninterest, whether it's a constitutional interest or sort of quasi-\nconstitutional because of the nature of the deprivation, due process\nkind of thing, the Court has work to do.\nBut I thought we sort of got rid of that at the top by sort of assessing this\nnot as being in one of those categories, and so then the question\nbecomes: How does the Court treat it?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nWell, I --I think, again, the immigration cases are -- are a good\nexample.\nAnd I -- I take Your Honor's point that perhaps there's a quasi-\nconstitutional interest at play.\nBut -- but that interest is never articulated by the Court in\nSchneiderman or -- or in Woodbury.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut what do you do with Grogan? I mean, I thought from then on, the\nsort of way in which we thought about this was Congress --you know,\nthere's no constitutional interest here, Congress didn't speak to it.\nSo what does Congress's silence tell us about what it intended with\nrespect to the cause of action that it was creating?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nI -- I think cases like Grogan and Herman & MacLean are illustrative that\nour view of the methodology is the more accurate one because, in those\ncases, the Court did undertake a balancing analysis.\nIt didn't just observe a statutory lacuna and decide: Well, certainly,\npreponderance of the evidence applies.\nIt -- it weighed the interests at stake.\nAnd --and granted, in those cases, it determined after that weighing\npreponderance of the evidence was the relevant standard.\n### Justice Jackson:\nDid it do so on the basis of the Court's own view of the interests in stake,\nor was it trying to ascertain how Congress viewed those interests?\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nI -- I think the -- the structure and nature of the statute is relevant to\nthe court's determination of how it manages these factual questions.\nUltimately, of course, courts will answer these sorts of procedural\nquestions consistent with general principles that have emerged from\nother cases.\nAnd those principles, I think, do embody a default rule in a weak sense,\nwhich is that when there's a statutory lacuna, those -- those questions\nare reserved for -- for the courts and that in civil litigation, issues tend\nto be decided under the preponderance of the evidence, unless the\nreasons that courts have developed for exercising a more stringent\nstandard apply.\nSo I think the question here is whether those reasons are present in this\ncase.",

Bateman:\nCertainly not.\nBut I think one operative question is whether those rights are waivable\nby the individual.\nAnd because they're not waivable in the FLSA context, that is an\nindicator that there's a broader remedial scheme at issue than just\nindividual monetary damages.\n### Justice Alito:\nWhat about revocation of an occupational license for somebody whose\nwhole livelihood depends upon pursuing that license, pursuing that\noccupation?\n### Justice Alito:\nSomebody's worked for 30 years as a barber and let's say the District of\nColumbia yanks the -- the license to operate a barbershop.\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nI -- I think, if there is a statutory -- if there is statutory silence on that\nmatter, there, as far as I can see, would be no reason to believe that a\nhigher standard of proof would be necessary to carry out the statutory\nscheme at issue.\nI think, again, the FLSA is just such a unique statute in terms of its\nbreadth, its statement of purpose, and its remedial nature, its non-\nwaivability.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, if the test is whether it's particularly important and you want the\njudiciary to decide whether things are particularly important, then we\nwould need some methodology to determine whether something is\nparticularly important.\n### Lauren E. Bateman:\nYes, Your Honor.\nI --I think that's right.\nI think this Court can adhere to the standard that -- that it's developed\nin previous cases and --and determine that, you know, a right is\nparticularly important where it implicates not just individual monetary\ndamages.",
