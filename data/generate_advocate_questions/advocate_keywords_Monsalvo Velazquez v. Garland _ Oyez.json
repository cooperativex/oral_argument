  "background": "Mr. Velázquez, a Mexican citizen, entered the U.S. without authorization in 2005. In 2011, the Department of Homeland Security sought to remove him and served a deficient Notice to Appear that lacked time and place details. In 2013, Velázquez admitted to unlawful entry and sought withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. In March 2019, an Immigration Judge denied these requests but granted voluntary departure within 60 days. Velázquez appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which dismissed his appeal in October 2021 and reinstated the 60-day voluntary departure period. On December 13, 2021, Velázquez filed a motion to reopen his case to apply for cancellation of removal, arguing he had accrued 10 years of continuous presence due to his deficient Notice to Appear. The BIA denied this motion, finding Velázquez had not asserted “new facts” and that the motion was untimely, filed after the 60-day voluntary departure period. Velázquez then filed a motion to reconsider, challenging only the timeliness determination, which the BIA also denied. Velázquez filed a petition for review in federal court, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit denied review, concluding that Mr. Velázquez failed to voluntarily depart or file an administrative motion within 60 calendar days, the maximum period provided by statute. 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(2).",

I mean, as I read your brief anyway,\nthe Sunday provision was pretty clear early on, but then Saturday kind\nof crept in there somewhere along the way.\nAnd so, usually, we think of statutory -- timing deadlines as not sort of\nflexible in that way.\n### Gerard J.

You don't need the common law.\nCommon law provides a background for what Congress was doing when\nit passed this law, correct?\n### Gerard J.

Cedrone:\nThat's right.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\nAnd the old soil here, even according to the government, was that \"day\"\nwas defined according to the regulation.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's right.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\nNow the question is do we follow the government's new argument that\nthere's somehow a difference in how \"day\" is defined with respect to\ncourt obligations or -- I --I don't know where they get the word\n\"substantive\" from --or substantive obligations, correct?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's right.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nBut, if I look at the old soil, why don't I look at the law itself, the INA law,\nand when Congress wanted to talk about calendar days, it used\n\"calendar day\" instead of the word \"day,\" correct? I'm looking at 8\nU.S.C. 1228(b)(3), which has to do with the Attorney --Attorney General\nnot executing any order for expedited removal until 14 calendar days\nhave passed, correct?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI confess I'm not familiar with that particular provision, but our position\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd something like this would be a clear deviation?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI think it probably would be.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\nNow am I -- I want to go back to the jurisdictional question that Justice\nThomas started with.\nThe government didn't raise a jurisdictional -- this jurisdictional point\nbefore the Tenth Circuit, did it?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nIt did not.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd it raised it in its petition for opposition, but you didn't reply to it\nuntil your reply, correct?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's correct.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nHas this percolated among other courts yet?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI don't believe this particular issue -- well, I should say this.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nindependent jurisdictional basis, correct?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's right.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo hard to think why anybody would think they didn't have jurisdiction.\nBut, if we were to accept the government's ruling, do you know what\nother consequences this would have?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI think, if you accept the government's view of jurisdiction in this case, it\nwould be either a real sea change for immigration law because it would\nmean that reopening and reconsideration decisions aren't separately\nreviewable, as this Court has consistently pointed out in Reyes Mata, in\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nknow whether we would have granted cert if we knew it was one-off to\nstart with -- that everybody else appeals the order to remove, but you\ndidn't.\nSo I guess my question is, assuming we rule the way the government\nwants us to, do we know f ully the consequences of that?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI think it would be a lot of make-way arguments in the courts of appeals.\nThe government doesn't dispute, nor could it, that courts of appeals\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nCounsel, stop going to the substance.\nI'm trying to ask you a question.\nGiven that this is a new issue before us, isn't the best way to deal with it\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI agree, the Court doesn't need to weigh into the jurisdictional issue\nbeyond recognizing that this case falls within 1252(a)(1).\nI -- I do think there would be confusion if the Court were to side with the\ngovernment because the government doesn't dispute that courts of\nappeals can review this exact issue.\nIt just thinks you have to bundle it with other arguments.\nThere's nothing in the text of the statute that requires it.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Barrett\n### Justice Barrett:\nOkay.\nMy question on the merits.\nMost of the time when we think about this, and as I understand the\nregulatory backdrop, when we're thinking about filing something, the\nreason why it gets bumped over to, say, a Monday from a Saturday is\nthat the court's closed.\nBut could your client have departed on a Saturday? It just -- that -- that\nstrikes me as the difference here, that this isn't governing filing dates or\nsomething that you're doing. It's just saying that your authorization to\nbe in the country expires, you know, at that 60 -day mark.\nAnd it's not that the court was closed.\nI mean, your client could have departed, right?\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nThat's true.\nI can't dispute the factual premise that often somebody can get on a\nplane or drive across the border on a Saturday.\nThis principle is deeper than that, and there are several indications that\nthis principle is not just about court closures or filings.\nI think the best evidence of that is to go -- I'll start with the regulation\nand work outwards.\nSo the regulatory definition of \"day\" in Section 1001.1 says that\ndefinition of \"day,\" which builds in the traditional rule, applies to any\naction in immigration regulations.\nEven on the government's theory of how that deadline applies, that\nprinciple applies to things like getting married to maintain your visa\nstatus, regulatory deadlines for getting fingerprinted after you enter\nthe country, regulatory deadlines for taking a citizenship test.\nSo these are all things that are not filing, not court-related. Working\noutward from there, Rule 6(a), as we pointed out, also applies to any\napplicable statute and any court order.\nAnd so that, of course, covers things like filing in district court, but it\nalso covers things -- we give examples at page 18 of our reply brief -- of\ninjunctions that a court might enter imposing substantive obligations\non a party.\nSo say you're a defendant in a trade secrets suit.\nYou're found liable.\nThe court might enter an order at the end of the case saying: Defendant,\nyou have 30 days to turn over the misappropriated property.\nUnder Rule 6(a), that 30-day deadline clearly follows the traditional\nrule.\nAnd then working even outward from there, we have examples like --at\npage 28 of our br ief, cases like the Aetna case applying this traditional\nprinciple to deadlines under ERISA, which bind private parties, private\nplans, requires them to take all sorts of actions vis --vis each other\noutside the context of litigation.\nAnd then this Court's decision in Street, which applied this principle to a\nstatute that sets time limits on the President's authority to take action,\nas we explain in the brief, that statute in Street is parallel to this statute.\nSection 1229c gives the Attorney General the authority to grant\nvoluntary departure and then places a time limit on it.\nThe statute in Street worked similarly.\nThe Court applied the traditional rule there.\nIt should apply the traditional rule here.",

Working\noutward from there, Rule 6(a), as we pointed out, also applies to any\napplicable statute and any court order.\nAnd so that, of course, covers things like filing in district court, but it\nalso covers things -- we give examples at page 18 of our reply brief -- of\ninjunctions that a court might enter imposing substantive obligations\non a party.\nSo say you're a defendant in a trade secrets suit.\nYou're found liable.\nThe court might enter an order at the end of the case saying: Defendant,\nyou have 30 days to turn over the misappropriated property.\nUnder Rule 6(a), that 30-day deadline clearly follows the traditional\nrule.\nAnd then working even outward from there, we have examples like --at\npage 28 of our br ief, cases like the Aetna case applying this traditional\nprinciple to deadlines under ERISA, which bind private parties, private\nplans, requires them to take all sorts of actions vis --vis each other\noutside the context of litigation.\nAnd then this Court's decision in Street, which applied this principle to a\nstatute that sets time limits on the President's authority to take action,\nas we explain in the brief, that statute in Street is parallel to this statute.\nSection 1229c gives the Attorney General the authority to grant\nvoluntary departure and then places a time limit on it.\nThe statute in Street worked similarly.\nThe Court applied the traditional rule there.\nIt should apply the traditional rule here."

There\nwere reasons for the rules about filing, because courts were closed.\nSome of the things that you mentioned are things that would be more\ndifficult perhaps to accomplish on a weekend.\nOriginally, perhaps the rule for Sunday was based on religion.\nYou might argue that it should be extended to Saturday if your counsel -\n-if your -- your client has a -- if that is that --is -- is a holy day, a\nspecial day for your particular client.\nBut I can't think of any practical reason why there should be a rule -- a\ndifferent rule for departing the country.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nYeah.\nSo I think there's two -- two practical reasons, one more substantive\nand one more procedural.\nThis traditional rule, in our view, stems from a general principle that\nthere are certain legally set-aside days where presumptively at least the\ngovernment can't ask people to do stuff.\nAnd so the persistence of this rule, even in the face of 24/7 e-filing,\nshows that this is a principle that's deeper than just impracticability,\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, I mean, that's -- that doesn't strike me as a practical reason. Why\ncan't they say: You've got to get out of the country in 60 days? You can\nget out of the country just as easily on a Saturday or a Sunday as you can\non a Monday.\n### Gerard J. Cedrone:\nI'll mention just as an aside some of the amicus briefs go into the fact\nthat it -- it may well be more difficult to travel on the weekends.\nBut I guess putting that aside, the second practical reason, the\nprocedural one, is that we're talking about deadlines with severe\nconsequences.\nThe question of how and when your deadline runs should be easily\nunderstood and easily calculated, especially when there are severe\nconsequences.\nAnd on the government's view, you have to undertake a case-by-case\ndetermination for each deadline in the regulations and each deadline in\nthe INA.\nMaybe I could give an example.\nSo there's a 180-day deadline in the regulations, Section 1003.23, a 180\n-day for seeking relief from in absentia removal.\nThat statutory dead -- that regulatory deadline doesn't cross-\nreference the statute.\nSo you might think, if you pick up the regulation and pick up the\ndefinition, you know how it applies.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, but that -- that --in seeking relief, that -- that's requiring you to\nfile some sort of a document.\n### Gerard J.

Yang:\nIt's hard to avoid the \"final order of removal\" language because that's\nwhere the only jurisdictional grant is.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI'm not avoiding it.

It\nseems like a very technical way to go about this when we have a case\nthat already interprets motions -- or --or decisions that encompass\nreview of refusing to reopen or reconsider as final orders of removal for\nthis purpose.\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nMata did not say that every motion to reopen and every motion to\nreconsider, regardless of what it concerns, is subject to the jurisdictional\nprovision.\nAnd our point is most --most are included.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut why -- why wouldn't it be? Why wouldn't it be? We -- we are\n### Anthony A.

Yang:\nBecause, when the issue concerns a matter as collateral as this and, in\n### Justice Jackson:\nIt's not collateral because it relates to the final order of removal in the\nway that Mata indicated.\n### Anthony A. Yang:\nAnd, in addition, where you have judicial review elsewhere, Congress\nwould have thought that those collateral consequences could be\npursued but in a different judicial forum in a different way.\nIt's not unusual here, when --we're talking about removal proc\needings, where it doesn't affect the order of removal in any way. It really\ndoesn't.\nThis is all collateral. This order of removal is unchanged. There's not a\nword on that page in, what is it, 42 and 43a that would change.
