  "background": "A.J.T., a student with epilepsy, experiences seizures so severe in the morning that she cannot attend school until noon. Her parents repeatedly requested evening instruction from Osseo Area Schools to give her a school day length more comparable to her peers. Despite the District providing some accommodations, including one-on-one instruction, a slightly extended school day, and summer home instruction sessions, they denied the requests for evening instruction. The District’s Director of Student Services, responsible for Section 504 compliance, was unaware of the parents’ complaints and did not know that District policies allowed at-home schooling as an accommodation. A.J.T., through her parents, sued the District for disability discrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the District, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Sotomayor\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI'm not sure where any of these tests come from, because mens rea is\ngenerally willfulness, which requires knowing what the law is, but the\nstatute doesn't talk about willfulness.\nMotive, in -- intent -- we don't care about motive.\nWe've said that repeatedly in a bunch of different contexts. It's do you\nknow you're doing the act and are you intending to do the act.\nIf it violates the law, you're guilty.\nPardon the pun.\nThis is a tort, but you're responsible.\nOr you do it knowingly, knowing that you're doing the act. So I don't\nknow where the bad faith comes from.\nI don't know where the gross indifference comes from.\nI don't know where the deliberate indifference comes from. Have you\nfigured that out?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI think that that's part of the question that would have to happen if a\ncourt takes the other side's point that it should be intentional with\nrespect to all claims, injunctive -- injunctive and/or damages. So I take\ntheir point that maybe you need intentional conduct for an -- an\ninjunction, but I don't know why you need anything else.\n### Roman Martinez:\nRight.\nJustice Sotomayor, we agree with that -- the impulse underlying that\nquestion.\nI think those are some great questions for the other side. I think what I\n### Roman Martinez:\nWell, let me take a shot at it.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nOkay.\n### Roman Martinez:\nI think, cert -- certainly, with respect to liability and whether the\nstatute is violated, there's no intent requirement.\nIt's not in the statute.\nWhat the statute has is a causation requirement which is satisfied in\ncircumstances where a person's disability means that they're being\nexcluded from a building or a program or a service.\nSo there's just no way to -- to gin up a -- an intent requirement out of\nthat. I think what some courts have done in the context of damages is\nthat -- is they've sort of read the damages provisions and the -- the\ndamage -- the remedies that are available through the lens of the\nSpending Clause and said: We -- we require something more, and\nbecause we require actual notice to the recipient of federal funds before\nwe cut off federal funds, we should require some form of notice. And so,\nin the Title IX context, courts have applied a deliberate indifference-\ntype standard, and we think that -- that that's sort of the -- the\nuniform rule or at least the almost uniform rule that's applied by nine\ncircuits in this context. What the other side has, though, is a bad-faith-\nand-gross-misjudgment rule that is literally -- it comes out of\nnowhere, like nowhere.\nother than the five circuits that we're arguing about here, no court has\never embraced that test in any other context under the discrimination\nlaws, and we think that's a very high standard to meet.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI think you're going too far, though, meaning I don't know why you\ncan't have an intentional failure to reasonably accommodate, because\nthat's what discrimination is. And accommodation is: I'm not letting\nyou use a program that you're otherwise qualified for because I'm not\nletting you get to the program.\nEither you're not providing a ramp or you're not providing an\ninstrument that I could use.\nBy its own definition, that's intentional conduct, isn't it?\n### Roman Martinez:\nWell, I -- I don't think so, Your Honor.\nI think the reasonable accommodation problem arises in a context\nwhere there's no intent. And I totally agree with what the other side said\non page 30 of their brief in opposition and what this Court said in the\nChoate decision, where it recognized -- it recognized that the statutes\nprovide -- and this is page 30 in their brief -- the statutes prescribe at\nleast some unintentional yet harmful conduct, and talked about Choate,\nwhich itself recognized that the Rehabilitation Act targets\nunintentional discriminatory acts like architectural barriers.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nGot it.\n### Roman Martinez:\nSo those do not require intent and have never been understood to\nrequire intent.",

You\nthen have 10 circuits that have said you do have some form of intent\nrequirement for damages, and nine of those 10 circuits say that the test\nis deliberate indifference. There's a little bit of uncertainty about the\nFifth Circuit about what kind of intent is required.\nThe Fifth Circuit has suggested that deliberate indifference might not\nbe enough, but they haven't really clearly adopted a different intent\nstandard. But I think the other side says that there would be disarray if\nyou didn't resolve, like, every last issue in this case.\nThat's just not right. If you say the IDEA context doesn't create a special\nrule disfavoring kids in the education context, what's almost certainly\ngoing to happen is that the circuits out there are just going to apply their\nbaseline rule, and all 12 of the geographic circuits are going to say that\nintent isn't required.\n### Justice Barrett:\nWell, it might also be that this sparks percolation on this issue. I mean,\nmaybe what will happen is that there will be pushback of the sort that\nyour friend on the other side is advocating.\n### Roman Martinez:\nI -- I would doubt that because of the fact that the reason these five\ncourts have applied this Monahan test is really because, and as they\nexplained it very well in their brief in opposition, it's all about the I\nmean, look at their brief in opposition.\nThe first paragraph is all about, like, this is an IDEA case, and they're\nbasically trying to interpret these statutes in circumstances where kids\nhave protections under the IDEA to give them fewer protections under\nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Kavanaugh\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nA couple follow -ups.\nYou agree that there's an intent requirement for damages claims, but\nyou say it's deliberate indifference, correct?\n### Roman Martinez:\nYour Honor, in our opening brief, we did not take a position on that.\nWe did not take a position on whether there was an intent requirement,\nbut we certainly are not fighting that.\nWe didn't fight that below.\nI think the Eighth Circuit and nine other circuits say it's deliberate\nindifference.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThat sounds close to a yes. (Laughter.)\n### Roman Martinez:\nClose -- close -- close to a yes.\nWe -- you know, we would have taken a position on it if we thought that\nwas the question presented, but it isn't, so we -- we didn't have to.\n### Roman Martinez:\nBut I think that's fair.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAny problems with how they formulate it in their brief?\n### Roman Martinez:\nAs I understand their formulation, I agree with it.\nI think substantial likelihood is an appropriate way of -- of thinking\nabout, you know, substantial likelihood of a violation.\nI think the one thing I just want to be very clear on is you don't have to\nknow the law.\nYou have to know the facts that would give rise to the violation. And I\nthink that's an important caveat.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nWell, on that point, in my last question, there's a lot of line drawing that\nhas to go on in this context, I think, with school districts deciding\nwhether to provide services to 4:30 p.m. or until 6 p.m. And that's a very\nfact -intensive judgment on which the district court found that the\ndistrict officials exercised professional judgment, convened multiple IEP\nmeetings, extended the school day beyond the school day of her peers,\nimplemented many of Dr. Reichle's suggestions. Failure to provide\nextended schooling until 6 p.m. at home was, at most, negligent, is\nwhat the district court found. And I guess it's hard to know how you say\nthat it's substantially likely to be a violation when it's this fact-\n### Roman Martinez:\nRight.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nwords, the court on remand, if it's applying deliberate indifference, how\nshould it think about it as related to these facts?\n### Roman Martinez:\nWell, I think the first thing I would say is we -- we love the fact that we\nhave appellate courts, and the Eighth Circuit in this case said, looking at\nthose same facts, that we may well have established deliberate\nindifference.\nSo it took a different view.\nWe think, certainly, on the summary judgment record in this case, we\nwould get past, you know, the other side's motion for summary\njudgment on whether there was deliberate indifference. Obviously, it's\ngoing to be a -- a fact-bound analysis.\nIt's going to require close attention.\nAnd the sensitivity that this Court has -- has often said is very\nimportant in the IDEA context should, of course, apply in this context\ntoo.\nBut we think that we have good arguments and good facts for us that we\ncan prevail on deliberate indifference properly understood if this goes\nback down below.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThank you.",

And, in contrast, when an entity incurs\nliability but is only potentially going to have to be on the hook for\ninjunctive relief, the entity has a choice.\nThey can reject ongoing spending in exchange for not having continuing\ninjunctive relief.\nAnd that's not the case with backward -looking damages. And I think\nit's also not unusual for the Court to draw these types of lines in this\narea.\nIn Lane v.

And then again, I asked the question\nof Mr. Martinez, if -- if you're looking at it through a contract-type lens\nthrough the Spending Clause, why wouldn't a -- a state be on notice\nmore that a breach would incur damages than specific performance,\nwhich is an extraordinary remedy in contract at least? So one might\nthink, if -- if the state were on notice of anything, it might be\ninjunctions before damages rather than the other way around.\nThoughts?\n### Nicole F. Reaves:\nSo, as to the first part of your question, I don't think we're asking the\nCourt to draw a new line here because I think both Gebser and Davis\nalready strongly suggest this line between damages and injunctive\nrelief.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWell, but textual -- I understand that point, but I was focusing on the\nstatutory text.\nThe strength of the argument here is the statute doesn't draw the\ndistinction that Respondent proposed.\nAnd now you're asking us to do a similar thing, and I'm -- I'm just\nwondering about its consistency with contract-type analogies.\n### Nicole F. Reaves:\nRight.\nAnd so, as far as the contract analogy goes, I think that the -- the\ncontract analogy obviously isn't perfect because the focus here is -- is\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nMm-hmm.\n### Nicole F. Reaves:\nAnd if you've already had a violation of the statute and you're\nautomatically liable without any sort of intent requirement, that would\nweigh -- raise real notice problems.\nBut, unlike a traditional contract, a state can or a funded entity can\nwithdraw and -- to forgo ongoing injunctive relief.\nThat's not necessarily true of a contract, but I think, because of the way\nthe Spending Clause contract overlay works in this context, the notice\nconcerns are just less there. And I would also like to just briefly respond\nto Respondents' suggestion that injunctive relief is always going to be\nsignificantly more burdensome.\nPlaintiff still is going to need to prove both the violation and that they\nare entitled to injunctive relief, and that means they're going to need to\nshow that the on -- the violation is ongoing and that but for injunctive\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nit's just noticing that -- that it might be suggested by our cases? Or\nwould deliberate indifference be the appropriate standard for both\ndamages and injunctive relief?\n### Nicole F. Reaves:\nSo we think that -- and I think this is consistent with what we said in our\nbrief -- intent is not required to state a violation of the statute.\n### Nicole F.

So we cite the\nEleventh Circuit's decision in Liese in our briefing, and in that case, the\nissue was whether there was failure to provide a reasonable\naccommodation in the form of a sign language interpreter for a patient\nat a hospital, and the court found that there was enough to go to trial\nbecause there was deliberate indifference because these individuals had\nrepeatedly requested an interpreter. But there was no indication in that\ndecision that any of those choices made by the hospital were backed by\nsome sort of -- of animus on behalf -- you know, animus discriminating\nagainst individuals with disabilities.

      "dialogue": "Justice Alito\n### Justice Alito:\nWhat do you think was the impulse that led so many lower courts to\nadopt the standard that you find to be completely unsupported?\n### Nicole F. Reaves:\nSo I think the initial rationale was the one the court laid out in Monahan,\nthe Eighth Circuit laid out, which was this desire to harmonize the IDEA\nwith the -- with Section 504 and Title II. And I think that might have\nbeen understandable, but -- and, obviously, this Court found that logic\ncompelling in Smith, but I think, once Congress adopted 1415(l) and said\nthat nothing in the IDEA shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights,\nprocedures, and remedies available under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act,\nit was just abundantly clear that that harmonization is inappropriate.\nAnd I think there also might have been a little bit of a misunderstanding\nabout some of the daylight between these type of claims. I mean, my\nfriend laid out very well, I think, that -- different protections under the\nIDEA and Title II and Section 504, but there are some claims you just\ncan't bring under the IDEA. So, if an individual is on grade and they don't\nneed any special education, they're not going to get anything under the\nIDEA.\nBut, if they're using a wheelchair, they are going to potentially need a\nreasonable accommodation under the ADA.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, don't these two statutes proceed along very different lines? Under\nthe IDEA, the school district must provide a free appropriate public\neducation.\nThat can be extremely expensive, right?\n### Nicole F. Reaves:\nYes.\n### Justice Alito:\nThe antidiscrimination statutes, the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act,\nstart from the baseline that people with disabilities are supposed to be\ntreated the same as people without disabilities.\nBut they depart from the baseline because employers, for example, in\nthe employment context, must make a reasonable accommodation.\nBut there's a limit to the expense that an employer, for example, must\nbe -- is required to bear under the ADA. So is there a substantial\ndifference in that respect between the financial burden that these two\nstatutes impose on the regulated parties?\n### Nicole F. Reaves:\nNo, I -- I don't think so because the reasonable accommodation\nlimitation and particularly the \"reasonable\" part of that is baked into\nboth Title II and Section 504. That's been recognized since the 1970s,\nshortly after the Rehabilitation Act was adopted. And then Congress,\nwhen it enacted the ADA, said in Section 12201(a) that nothing in the\nADA shall be construed to apply a lesser standard than the standards\napplied under Title V of the Rehabilitation Act or the regulations issued\nby federal agencies pursuant to such title. So the reasonable\naccommodation limitation is baked into these Title II claims that can be\nbrought against public schools.\nAnd so the public school is going to be able to come forward and say:\nThis is not reasonable because we can't afford it because it's not the sort\nof thing that is a normal accommodation or because it would require a\nfundamental alteration in the programs that we -- we give to students.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, let me just give you one other example.\nI don't want to belabor this too much because it's a little -- it's a side\npoint. Suppose an employer in -- a -- a place of employment is open\nfrom 9 to 5.\nLet's say it's a store.\nFor some reason, it's open from -- it closes at -- at 5 p.m.\nAnd there's an employee with a disability similar to -- to the -- to\nA.J.T.'s disability here who can't work in the morning but could work\nlater in the day. Would that employer be required under the ADA to allow\nthis employer -- employee to work after closing time instead of during\nthe normal hours when this -- when this business is providing a service\nto the public?\n### Nicole F. Reaves:\nNo, because, under the reasonable accommodation framework, the\nemployer would be able to say: Well, this isn't a sort of accommodation\nthat's reasonable on its face or used in a variety of cases.\nThis isn't a sort of accommodation we've seen before.\nAnd that's a defense courts often recognize. And then they'd also say:\nWell, this would be a fundamental alteration to our business. And I\nthink, Justice Alito, one thing I would just point out is I actually think\nthat underscores some of the differences between the IDEA and Title II\nand Section 504 in the education context. You know, we have not taken\na position on this, but just because after-hours education is required\nunder the IDEA does not mean that that's a required reasonable\naccommodation under Title II and Section 504.\n### Justice Alito:\nAll right.\nThat's what I was asking about.\nThank you.",

Blatt:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should affirm\nMonahan. Bare IDEA violations do not support liability under Section\n504 or the ADA.\nInstead, the defendant must have acted with discriminatory intent.\nMonahan correctly described that intent as bad faith, which is the\nlongstanding term for actions done for an improper reason, here,\ndisability. 504 and Title II require discrimination by reason of disability.\nThis Court has held that the nearly identical text in Title VI requires\nintent to discriminate. Petitioner acknowledges that because the law\nhere expressly incorporates Title VI rights and remedies, discriminatory\nintent must be shown to get damages.\nBut Petitioner departs from that intent requirement for liability and\ninjunctions. That's wrong.\nWhen Congress wanted intent -free liability, it said so expressly.\nIn ADA's Title I and III, Congress spelled out reasonable\naccommodations intent-free claims and barred damages without\nintent for employers and altogether for hotels and hotdog stands.\nCongress did not plausibly disfavor states and localities in Title II. This\nCourt should decide the correct standard.\nThe petition ends with: \"What standard should apply under the ADA and\nRehab Act is a pure question of law.\nIt should be resolved in this case.\" That's a quote.\nWe agree. And reversing Monahan would expose 46,000 public schools\nto liability when, for 40 years, they have trained teachers, allocated\nbudgets, and obtained insurance, all in reliance on Monahan.\nEvery good-faith disagreement would risk liability or even the nuclear\noption, the loss of federal funding, which is over a hundred billion\ndollars.

So then they said: Well, Davis\nand Gebser said deliberate indifference, and they just misread it.\nI mean, the Fifth Circuit got it right. So, if you're going to rule against us,\nat least wipe the slate clean and say -- if you're going to -- they want to\nsay you have to follow Title VI because they don't make a difference in\nterms of parties and you have to use intent for damages, then intent for\ndamages should be intent to discriminate just like Title VI.

Blatt:\nSure.\n### Justice Jackson:\nIt -- it did not say decide the standard.\nI'm reading.\nThe question presented is whether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\nrequire children with disabilities to satisfy a uniquely stringent bad-\nfaith-or-gross - misjudgment standard when seeking relief for\ndiscrimination relating to their education.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nSo that can have two meanings.\nOne, you could put all the emphasis on \"uniquely stringent.\" Should\nthis Court adopt a uniquely stringent standard when it's called bad\nfaith? Or it could mean what we think the end of the petition said it\nmeant. Should a Court adopt the bad-faith standard, which is uniquely\nstringent? And the last page -- the last line of their petition says you\nshould decide what standard applies in this case. Now, if you want to\nread it as the \"should courts adopt uniquely stringent standards,\" then\nyou're right.\nThe -- the -- the parties agree.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAnd you're saying that's not the way you read it when I'm looking at\npage 27 of your bio, which says the bad-faith-or-gross -misjudgment\nstandard is an appropriate exercise of discretion; most importantly, it\naccounts for the unique nature of claims like Petitioner's, that is, claims\nby students with disabilities regarding the appropriateness of their IEPs.\nAnd you go on at length in talking about the unique nature of this\nparticular context and why it would justify having this standard as\nopposed to the standard that all the courts have applied in other\ncontexts.\n### Justice Jackson:\nYes.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nappeals' decision below is correct and it's correct because of the text,\nit's correct because it incorporates Title VI, and it's correct because it's\nbeen definitively interpreted in Alexander versus Sandoval, which is a\npretty big deal for the uniquely worded Title VI case. But, Justice\nJackson, there's no disagreement that we've always said that there is a\nbig problem with the other side's argument in the school context,\nbecause every IDEA disagreement now risks the loss of federal funding\nand injunctive relief.\nAnd so, yeah, that -- that -- that is a big deal.\nAnd in terms of damages, that's a big deal too if you have a deliberate\nindifference standard, which, to be fair to us, does not apply in any other\ncontext. So there's no question that there's an incoherent big mess of a\nregime because this Court started out in Davis saying that this is not an\naffirmative action case.\nAnd then you had Choate, which is maybe not Exhibit A, but it's Exhibit\nB for what this Court has called the bad old days, And that case has a lot\nof dicta that talks about reasonable accommodation. Monahan was\ndecided after Davis, before Choate.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut can I just -- can I just focus your attention on that? Because I don't\nunderstand why you are really pressing this idea that discrimination\nclaims in the context of reasonable accommodations and disability\naren't something unique. I mean, I -- I thought the -- the Alexander\nversus Choate line of thinking was that you can have discrimination in\nthis context, say, differently from maybe racial discrimination or gender\ndiscrimination when an entity that is responsible for accommodating\nsomeone with a disability doesn't act, that -- that you have benign\nneglect, meaning you're not doing it out of some sort of intent to treat\nthis person differently.\nIn fact, what you say is I'm treating this person the same, and the same\nis a world in which they can't walk up the stairs and they can't see the\nboard and they can't do the things that everybody else can do.

That's what this -- I mean, no.\nThat's what Judge Sutton said.\n### Justice Jackson:\nIt's not in the ADA?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nIt sure as heck is not in the statute.\nThe word \"reasonable\" is not in the statute.\nThe word \"accommodation\" is not in the statute.\nThis passive voice reading has got to be incorrect because it would bring\n### Justice Jackson:\nSo you -- you read -- you read disability discrimination statutes to not\nthat it's just about discriminatory intent, meaning not treating these\npeople the same as everyone else?\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nCorrect, and that is glaringly obvious when you look at the seminal\nstatute of the ADA because Title I for employers, Title III for country\nclubs and hotdog stands, have not only reasonable accommodations\nprovisions, Justice Jackson, but they don't make hotdog stands liable for\ndamages.\nAnd a made-up judicial damage remedy comes from thin air.",

Blatt:\nWell, I -- we would welcome that if you're going to have a deliberate\nindifference standard, that it be as high as possible because, if you have\nthese -- again, what the school districts are worried about is because\nyou -- you -- you have good-faith disagreements in all -- I mean, these\nare really tough cases on -- in terms of, you know, how much support.\nHere, the -- the -- s he had 10 specialists.\nSo these are just tough cases.\nAnd so the question was how much support she should be given at\nhome.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nI guess what I'm getting at is deliberate indifference can be fairly\nprotective -- as defined by the Solicitor General, fairly protective of\nschool districts in the sense that the law's not like you open a code book\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nYes.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nIf you would define it that way, that would be great.\nI mean, we would appreciate that, although we do think, if you're going\nto incorporate Title VI, I mean, you're now just saying the Fifth Circuit is\nwrong.\nThe Fifth Circuit said, oh, I don't know, Sandoval looks likes it says\nintent; it doesn't say deliberate indifference.\nAnd they -- these are all Spending Clause statutes.\nSo Title IX, Title VI, the Rehab Act, the Affordable Care Act incorporates\nall these.\nThey -- their -- and this is a one area.\nAnd Justice Barrett is correct, this is a big, messy area. So I don't blame\nyou for not wanting to get into it, but we would at least appreciate that\nyou make clear that there's a level set particularly on damages.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThank you.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Jackson\n### Justice Jackson:\n?\nYeah.\nI just am still struggling with how you account for the language in the\ndisability discrimination statutes that goes beyond discrimination and\ndiscriminatory intent. And so I'm looking, for example, at the Title II\nlanguage which says, \"No qualified individual with a disability shall, by\nreason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied\nthe benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or\nbe subjected to discrimination by such entity.\" And my understanding\nof the way at least that courts have been interpreting this is you don't\nneed discriminatory intent in a situation in which a person is alleging,\nfor example, that they have been excluded from the participation. And\nyou seem to be suggesting that you still have to have that element in\nsome way, and I'm confused by that.\n### Lisa S. Blatt:\nSure.\nAnd you have to start from the fact of, what is Congress's authority to\neven pass Title -- Title II? It's not a Commerce Clause legislation.\nso you have to see it through the lens of -- of Congress's power under\nSection 5. But, even putting that aside, if you don't read it -- if you just\nlook at Titles I and Title III, where they spell out disparate impact, and so\nthat -- if you read that statute in the passive voice to require disparate\nimpact, all the disparate impact and reasonable accommodation\nprovisions and definitions and contours are all superfluous. So that if\nyou just looked at -- I actually think this case is easier under Title II\nbecause you don't have the Choate baggage.\nBut, if you just look at Title II, it's an easy case that there is no\nreasonable accommodations requirement at all.\nThat -- that's -- that's our -- that's our stronger case, is under Titles -\n- Title II, because Titles I and Title III are so chockful of t he contours.\nAnd there's no reasonable requirement in II.\nSo it's made up.\nIt doesn't say you have to reasonably accommodate.\nOn the other side, they say the definition is any -- you know, remove\nstructural, communications, transportation barriers and auxiliary aids.\nBut there's no word \"reasonable\" in there.\nSo it has to be read in when it's actually defined in great details in I and\nIII.\nWhat it means to modify the program, what an -- undue hardship is a\nfour -part test, and what is -- what is readily achievable is a four-part\ntest.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThank you.",

Rebuttal, Mr. Martinez?\n### Roman Martinez:\nYour Honors, I'm not going to dignify Ms. Blatt's name -calling here\nwith a response in kind, though I appreciate that she withdrew the\ncharges here, although perhaps a bit under duress. I do want to address\nwhether we were incorrect in characterizing our position, and the\nanswer is absolutely not.\nYou heard her say today that she was radically defending the Eighth\nCircuit's decision in this case.\nWell, that decision includes Footnote 2, which expressly characterized\nMonahan as applying a higher test, a two-tiered test.\nSo, if she's radically defending that, then she's radically defending the\ntwo-tiered approach that I think she said was completely wrong. We\nwould also encourage you to look at page 23, in addition to all the other\npages that were cited, where she said that the universe of plaintiffs with\nclaims affected by the question presented is narrow.\nFor educational discrimination plaintiffs not covered by the IDEA, such\nas college students, a bad-faith or gross-misjudgment standard does\nnot apply. That's exactly the opposite of what she's saying now. So what\nis at issue in this case? I think the most important thing we heard from\nMs. Blatt is when she conceded in questioning from",

This is a revolutionary and radical argument that\nhas not been made in this Court and that she's trying to get you to\ndecide on the basis of essentially no briefing.\nThere are -- the -- the question of whether reasonable\naccommodations are required is easy.\nThere are subsidiary questions that are challenging.\nYou should not address those subsidiary questions in this case because\nwe haven't had briefing.\nIt's unfair to you.\nYou don't have a decision below. It's unfair to us.\nIt's unfair to our amici, the disability rights community, who would have\nrung a five-alarm fire if they had known that reasonable\naccommodation claims were on the table.\nSo you should not address that.\nYou should apply your waiver rules. If you do address some of this stuff,\nJustice Kavanaugh, I would encourage you to look at the COPAA amicus\nbrief.\nOn pages 18 to 29, it has a very good discussion of the kinds of cases and\nwhere the different standards might make a difference. I think, on the\nmerits, the most important point Ms. Blatt made was this assertion,\nwhich I would characterize as incorrect in the extreme, that the ADA\ndoes not talk about or somehow ratify reasonable accommodation\nclaims.\nI would point the Court most importantly to Section 12201(a), in which\nthe ADA Title II expressly incorporates by reference the regulations that\nhad been enacted under the Rehabilitation Act, all of which expressly\nembrace reasonable accommodation claims. In addition to that, I would\npoint the Court to other provisions of the ADA: 12101(a)(5), 12131(2),\n12201(h).\nAll of those refer to either reasonable accommodations or reasonable\nmodifications.\nSo, with respect, I think that's wrong. Finally, let me just take a step\nback, Your Honors, and talk about really what's issue -- what's at issue\nin this case.\nThis case started narrow.\nIt was about a sliver of plaintiffs.\nIt's now quite broad because of the arguments the district is making.\nIf you accept her arguments, think of all the people who are going to be\naffected.\nThink of five-year-old Ehlena Fry with cerebral palsy, who needs the\nhelp of her service dog, Wonder.\nThink about George Lane, the Tennessee man forced to crawl up two\nflights of stairs in order to have his court -- his day in court.\nThink about Ava, who desperately needs every precious hour of school\nso she can learn to communicate with her parents.
