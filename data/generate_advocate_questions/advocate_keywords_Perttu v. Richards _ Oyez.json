  "background": "Richards, an inmate at Michiganâ€™s Baraga Correctional Facility, sued Resident Unit Manager Thomas Perttu for sexual harassment and retaliation. Richards alleged that Perttu destroyed multiple grievances he attempted to file regarding Perttu's sexual abuse. Additionally, Richards claimed Perttu threatened to kill him if he continued trying to file grievances and wrongfully placed him in administrative segregation. After Perttu moved for summary judgment arguing the inmates failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and Richards cross-moved raising constitutional claims, the district court denied both motions due to factual disputes. A magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing and recommended finding that Perttu proved the inmates failed to exhaust remedies. The district court adopted this recommendation and dismissed the case. Richards appealed, and after requesting supplemental briefing on whether the Seventh Amendment requires a jury for exhaustion disputes intertwined with case merits, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that it does and reversed the judgment of the district court.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Jackson\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut, Ms. Sherman, do we really have to get into that? I guess what I was a\nlittle confused about from your briefing was that I took you to concede\nthat there's intertwinement here.\nAnd if that's the case, we can just assume, I guess, that ex haustion does\nnot entitle you to a jury.\nThat's the part of this that would ordinarily say you don't get a jury, but\nit's the fact of intertwinement that brings to the fore the question of\nwhether or not the Seventh Amendment has to be satisfied.\nSo we don't really have to worry or think about or rule on whether or not\nthe exhaustion claim gets a jury independent of the other one, right?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nI don't think the Court has to rule on that.\nI think it's a question that is naturally embedded in the question\npresented.\n### Justice Jackson:\nI understand, but if I assume it, okay, so fine, aren't we still faced with\nthe question that you present, as a matter of your question presented, is\nthen we have intertwinement of a claim that does not get a jury, the\nexhaustion claim, with a claim that does? Do you concede that the First\nAmendment retaliation claim is one that would ordinarily go to the jury?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nWhen -- when the right to a jury trial accrues and exhaustion has been\nmet, I agree that that is a claim that should go to the jury.\nAnd this Court has been very clear that 1983 claims are entitled to a jury\ntrial.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAll right.\nSo we do have the intertwinement.\nAt least you concede it in your brief.\nAnd so why wouldn't the sort of standard Beacon Theatres view of how\nwe deal with that situation apply here?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nBeacon Theatres doesn't apply here for a number of reasons.\nOne, Beacon Theatres was driven by a concern for collateral estoppel.\nWould there -- would there be a preclusive effect that would completely\ncut off any right to have the -- the --the jury trial on the merits?\n### Justice Jackson:\nI don't see that in the opinion.\nI mean, I see that it talks about preclusive effect, but that didn't\nnecessarily seem to me to be driving the analysis.\nAnd -- and we've had a lot of cases that have applied this sort of\nintertwinement principle in which preclusion really hasn't been the\nmain focus.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nI think Beacon Theatres itself talked about preclusion, preclusive effect,\nand that being a concern.\nAnd later on, this Court in Parklane Hosiery said, when we looked at\nBeacon Theatres, which, again, this Court has said is -- collateral\nestoppel is only a flexible, judge-made doctrine, and -- and this Court\n### Justice Jackson:\nAll right.\nSo why isn't that a case here? I mean, what --what law do we have that\nsays that an exhaustion determination by a judge in this situation that\nrequires them to find all the facts about whether or not there was actual\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nWell, what we have here is the flexible doctrine of collateral estoppel\nand what we know about collateral estoppel and why it's applied and\nwhy it doesn't get applied. And one of the big issues here is that you\ndon't -- this Court has said over and over in cases, and so have the lower\ncourts, that collateral estoppel is applied -- is not applied when the\nlitigants have not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate.\nAnd when a litigant is litigating -- on either side is litigating\nexhaustion, they have not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate on\nthe merits even if there are overlapping factors.",

Sherman:\nUnder the Prison Rape Elimination Act, First Amendment retaliation for\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAll right.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo that's it.\nBut what happens to the ordinary prisoner? If we announced the rule\nthat you want us to announce, which is exhaustion never goes to a jury,\nin the mine-run of cases that are not rape-related, prisoners are\nprecluded, practically speaking.\nWe have an amicus brief that says that most exhaustion requirements\nare --half of them, half the states, are 15 days or less.\nAnd in the others, they are matters of days more than that but no more\nthan 30.\nMost of the time, when you file a suit as a prisoner, it takes --the answer\ntakes 30 days.\nSo most cases as a practical matter would be precluded if we adopt your\nrule that exhaustion under all circumstances is not preclusive.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nI don't agree that in most cases the prisoner would not be able to return.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy not?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo, if they're very short, it seems to me, as a practical matter, I can't see\nhow almost any prisoner could go back.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nYou have 31 states, the District of Columbia, and the Bureau -- Federal\nBureau of Prisons, all that allow for some level of discretion to excuse\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWait a minute. That depends on you, meaning the prison.\nWhy would a prison ever do it? Are you aware of any prison that says you\nfailed to exhaust, but now you can come back?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nThe reason -- I assume that when they put it -- they can -- they don't\nhave to put it in their policy, so if they put it in their policy, I assume that\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThis is news to me that there is any state that says if you fail to -- you go\nto court, they say you failed to exhaust after a factual finding, that we're\nnow going to let you come back to court after you've brought it back to\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nDoes your state do that?\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nYes.\nYes.\nWe have a provision.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nNo, no.\nPoint -- I'd like you --I ask the Court to -- to have you give us examples\nof that situation occurring.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nI -- I can't provide those examples.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nYou can't because I haven't found one.\nThe policy is discretionary.\n### Ann M. Sherman:\nWell, I --this policy is discretionary.\nAnd I -- the reason that a prison system would want to do that is\nbecause everything in the PLRA is designed to encourage, to allow the\nprison system to work out their problems, and they do want to work\nthose out.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nCounsel, what you are proposing to me is that they have an exhaustion\nrequirement that they're willing to excuse every time a prisoner goes to\ncourt, the court says you failed to exhaust, and now the prison's going to\nsay come back and we'll let you exhaust now anyway.\n### Ann M.

      "dialogue": "Justice Barrett\n### Justice Barrett:\nCounsel, can I ask you a question? This is a methodological one.\nIn some ways, this case presents the problem that we've seen in the\nSecond Amendment context because this is a history and tradition test,\nbut it's one that goes all the way back to Justice Story in, like, 1812,\nright? And, you know, in other cases, we've been able to draw analogs\nbased on the cause of action.\nAnd I think that's a more or less stable line when you're trying to find a\nhistorical analog, is this more like a common law or an equitable\nquestion.\nThis defense thing is a lot harder, right, especially since there was no\nreally good analog at the time of the founding.\nSo I think what we have now is Congress coming up with something new\nand then how do -- what do we do in the face of historical uncertainty.\nAnd, you know, functional considerations may guide, but I guess what\nI'm trying to figure out --and this is really just a question -- I mean, it's\ntrue, as you say, that one set of circumstances we could look at in\nmaking a judgment about whether this goes to a jury or has to go to a\njury if he invokes the Seventh Amendment right is the factual nature of\nAnother one, though, is does Congress have some room here to create\nnew defenses that are functioning more as equitable, like these\nthreshold questions.\nAnd it seems to me l ike in Wetmore, the Court did, even though\njurisdiction was a jury issue in the beginning, did kind of back off a little\nbit and said: Well, you know, a judge has discretion to go one way or\nanother based on the 1875 Act that didn't lock in the form of pleading.\nSo, I mean, I -- I guess my question is: In the face of historical\nuncertainty, how do we weigh what Congress has to say about threshold\nconsiderations? Because it is clear that in the PLRA, exhaustion was\ndesigned to try to weed out suits.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nOkay.\n### Justice Barrett:\nI'm not saying that that's determi native.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nRight.\n### Justice Barrett:\nI'm just trying to figure out how to think about it.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nI think I understand the question.\nI mean, I think most of your question is sort of answered by the detailed\nanalysis of the majority opinion and Justice Scalia's concurring opinion,\nwhich the majority said that they agreed with in full in Del Monte Dunes.\nAnd, there, I mean, history certainly was the guide and -- and provided\nthe analog, which was a common law, you know, tort claim for damages,\nwas the historical analog that allowed the Court to say: No question that\na 1983 action for damages is an action at law.\nAnd so the question is, you know, how -- what work does the history do\non the specific issue question, and I think the Court resolved that by\nsimply saying: Where we don't have a guide, we look to precedent and\nthen, you know, functional considerations.\nAnd the Court described those functional considerations as preserving\nthe -- the jury's historic role as the trier of fact. So I think it's sort of a\nwell -worn path. And the -- the only thing I would add is that this Court\nlast term in Jarkesy pointed out that Congress can't sort of take an\naction at law and morph it into something else by tweaking its elements\nor adding something or narrowing it in some respect and then just\nsaying: Hey, this isn't actually the common law cause of action\nanymore.\n### Justice Barrett:\nYeah.\nBut, in Jarkesy -- I agree, but in Jarkesy, we drew an analogy to fraud and\nsaid, like, this is fraud, it's analogous to frog and -- fraud, not frog, sorry\nAnd, here, the problem is we don't have that same line.\nAnd I'm not saying that -- I'm not saying that you lose.\nI'm just saying we haven't had a case quite like this where we had to\nmake that methodological choice, which does make it a bit different.\nAnd I think Wetmore does complicate the question --the issue a little\nbit for you.\n### Lori Alvino McGill:\nSo I think, if you --if you wanted to take a slightly more circuitous route\nthan what Justice Scalia and the majority did in Del Monte Dunes, what\nyou would say is: We have this action at law.\nThere's no specific analog.\nBut you could still look to history to see, for example, well, what are the\ntypes of -- you know, would a jury have --have gotten to decide factual\nissues with respect to an affirmative defense in this type of tort action\nand common law.\nWe think that historical answer is very clear.\nSo, even though there wasn't an affirmative defense called\n\"exhaustion\" in 1791, there were affirmative defenses to tort liability\ndamages, including the statute of limitations.\nAnd we know that juries decided factual disputes with regard to an\naffirmative defense.",
