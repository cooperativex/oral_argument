  "background": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe'll hear argument next in Case 23-677, Royal Canin versus\nWullschleger.\nMs. Wellington.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Eighth Circuit's\ndecision below is an extreme outlier.\nIt conflicts with the text and structure of Section 1367 and with more\nthan a century of precedent.\nChief Justice Marshall held in Mollan against Torrance in 1824 that in a\ndiversity case, a federal court's jurisdiction once vested cannot be\ndivested by subsequent events.\nThe Court extended that reasoning to removal actions in Kirby against\nAmerican Soda in 1904.\nAnd in 1938, this Court held in St. Paul Mercury that if the plaintiff after\nremoval amends his pleadings, this does not deprive the district court of\njurisdiction because the defendant's statutory right to removal should\nnot be subject to the plaintiff's caprice.\nThe second Justice Marshall confirmed that conclusion in Carnegie -\nMellon against Cohill in 1988, and Justice Scalia concurred in Rockwell in\n2007.\nRespondents ask this Court to upset that settled interpretation,\nclaiming that it conflicts with the text of Section 1367.\nBut Congress codified this Court's longstanding precedent in the text of\nSection 1367 itself, making clear that if the federal court has original\njurisdiction, it shall continue to have supplemental jurisdiction unless\nCongress expressly provided otherwise.\nRespondents cannot cite a single decision of this Court, a single decision\nof a court of appeals outside of the Eighth Circuit, or a single treatise\nthat supports their position.\nRespondents realize how weak their case is and instead ask the Court to\ndecide something else, whether Grable should be overruled and, if not,\nwhether Grable's requirements were met.\nThis Court did not grant certiorari on either question.\nGrable is settled law, and the Eighth Circuit correctly applied it here.\nThe Court should affirm its longstanding precedent and reverse the\ndecision below.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Wellington:\nSo this Court has treated these two situations differently, and Justice\nScalia explained why in Rockwell.\nSo there was a concern in Rockwell that when a plaintiff goes into\nfederal court, pleads a federal question, and then immediately or\nsubsequently drops it, that they're trying to plead their way into federal\ncourt.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo forgetting what the reason for that is, you do agree with that rule\nthat once I file a suit in federal court as an original matter, then take out\nthe federal claims, leaving only state law claims, there's nothing at that\npoint for the federal court to do? It's not a doctrine of discretion\nanymore. The federal court has to dismiss.\nIs that correct?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThat is how we have asked this Court to read Rockwell.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nYes.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThat is our view.\n### Justice Kagan:\nSo, if that's the case, I don't think that your arguments from 1367 can be\nright because your arguments from 1367 would suggest the opposite\nresult in the case that I gave.\nIn other words, it's very hard to read 1367 as imposing some kind of\ndistinction between original cases and removed cases.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo I agree, Your Honor, that there is no distinction in the text of 1367\nitself.\nThis Court could revisit its decision in Rockwell or limit it to the FCA\ncontext.\nWe haven't asked the Court to do that because we think that we win on\n### Justice Kagan:\nI guess what it suggests to me, though, is, if you were willing to say,\nlook, the Rockwell understanding of original cases is settled, we're not\ncontesting that, then I think your arguments from 1367 go away\nbecause 1367 just doesn't create the kind of distinction that you're\nasking us to create.\nSo either you lose as to removed cases too, or these arguments from the\ntext are just not going to get us to your result.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo we disagree, Your Honor, with your interpretation of the text of\nSection 1367.\nWe think Congress has ma de clear that there is supplemental\njurisdiction unless Congress has expressly provided otherwise.\nIt hasn't done that.\nAnd I think it's very important to consider how Congress came to write\nSection 1367.\nIt was in response to Finley, where this Court took an extremely narrow\nview of -- pendent-claim and pendent-party jurisdiction, pendent-\nparty jurisdiction in particular, and Congress said no, that's not what we\nwant.\nWe want a broader view of pendent -claim and pendent-party\njurisdiction.

Wellington:\nNo, Your Honor.\n### Justice Jackson:\nAll right.\nSo it seems to me then your argument comes down to the impact of\nremoval because somehow, even though in a situation in which the\nplaintiff amends, if it was brought originally in federal court or amends\nif it's brought originally in st ate court, those have an impact, you say, on\nfederal question jurisdiction.\nSomehow, if the defendant removes before the plaintiff can drop the\nfederal claims, you say no impact on federal question jurisdiction.\nIs that right?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThat's correct.\n### Justice Jackson:\nWhy?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo this Court explained in St. Paul Mercury that once you've removed to\nfederal court, there is a removal statute and the defendants have a right\nto remove.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut the removal statute doesn't say, as I think",

Wellington:\nThat's correct.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThe part in the footnote, you think that's solid.\n### Katherine B.

Wellington:\nI -- I think that's right, and I think it is important that this Court was\naware of the question, continued to apply its precedents, longstanding\npreceden t in Cohill.\nAnd I don't think you can write Cohill, which is all about this is a doctrine\nof discretion.\nI don't think you can write Cohill if you think that the court didn't have\njurisdiction.",

Wellington:\nI think that's possible, Your Honor, but I think this is a pretty unique\ncase.\nWe searched high and low, and the only two cases we found that went\nthe other way was one district court case from 1915 and one district\ncourt case from 1940.\nThat is overwhelming precedent in the courts of appeals.\nAnd if you look at cases like Boelens, which is a case that Justice Scalia\ncited in Rockwell from the Fifth Circuit, it very carefully explains the\nreasoning of why we treat these two circumstances differently. I think\nyou also have to look at this Court's precedents, cases like International\nCollege of Surgeons, Rosado, Carlsbad, Osborn against Haley.\nAll of those cases are suggesting that this is a doctrine of discretion.\nSo this Court has been giving the lower federal courts the same signal\nfor many, many decades that this is how we're going to treat this\nsituation, and we think that's what Congress codified in the text of\nSection 1367 itself.\n### Justice Alito:\nWell, do you think that --that courts of appeals read our decisions\ndifferently than we may? I mean, you know, I'm --I was on a court of\nappeals for 15 years.\nIf I saw a strong dictum in a Supreme Court decision, I would very likely\njust salute and move on.\nBut, here -- (Laughter.)",

What's the justification for this?\nPlaintiff manipulation, correct?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nIt's much broader than that, Your Honor.\nSo judicial efficiency is a very important reason why Congress enacted\nthe Gibbs principles into Section 1367.\nSo a case may be pending for two or three years.\nThe district court might be really familiar with it.\nIt might be a really straightforward question of state law.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo how doesn't Rule 15 take care of that? It gives plaintiffs a narrow\nwindow to amend and, otherwise, it needs to seek permission.\nSo why didn't the district court simply deny permission here?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThis case was pending almost two years before the amendment was\nmade, but it was still an amendment as of right in this case.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nIt wasn't within the window permitted by the rule.\n### Katherine B.

Wellington:\nTwo responses, Your Honor.\nSo I think it's important to keep in mind that the 1911 version of the\nstatute, the predecessor of 1447 that was in effect during St. Paul\nMercury, had basically the same text as it did today.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nI grant -- I grant you that.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nYes.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nAnd now it's come back to looking more directly at the -- the then-\noperative complaint, doesn't it?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo I think it is important that this Court reached the ruling that it did in\nSt. Paul Mercury under the old text.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nYes.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nWe've been around that --that tree a few times. So putting aside that\npoint, have you got anything else you want to say about it?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nCertainly. So they didn't make that argument in the red brief because it\ndoesn't answer the question.\nThe question is whether the federal court has jurisdiction or not.\nWe think that's answered at the time of removal.\nAnd this Court, in the Wisconsin Department of Corrections case, said\nthat Section 1447 was merely procedural.\nIt did not affect the district court's jurisdiction.\nSo I think you would have to revisit that case in order to read 1447 here\nthe way you suggest.\n### Justice Gorsuch:\nOkay.\nThank you.",

There's just\nboxes everywhere where, you know, in the diversity context, destroying\ndiversity almost always compels dismissal or a remand, but reducing\nthe amount in controversy or changing citizenship of a party almost\nnever does. Right? Is that correct?\n### Katherine B.

Wellington:\nI think you're right.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nOr the other side can correct me if I'm wrong too.\nYeah.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nI think you're right, Your Honor, that there are different rules that apply\nin different circumstances, that they have different policy concerns or\nlongstanding prudential concerns and that this Court shouldn't go\naround disrupting those rules.\nThere are lots of different rules that apply with respect to adding diverse\nparties. Sometimes you can do that.\nSometimes you can't. You can add a non-diverse successor in interest,\nfor example.\nSo there's lots of different circumstances.\nAnd we simply ask the Court to apply settled law.\nWe don't think the Court has to come up with a unifying theory for all\nthese different areas of the law.\nCongress acted with an important reason here with respect to\nsupplemental jurisdiction.\nIt wanted to protect the defendant's right to remove.\nAnd I think that's why you see this broad text here.\nAnd as well as judicial efficiency.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nAnd by \"settled law,\" you mean Footnote 6, you mean Cohill? Or what\nare you referring to there?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nSo you're right, Your Honor.\nSo St. Paul Mercury, Cohill, and Rockwell.\nThere are also cases like Carlsbad, where this Court expressly asked, is a\nCohill remand -- that's the phrase the Court used -- is a Cohill remand\ndiscretionary? I don't think this Court could answer the question yes\nwithout having, again, decided this question.\nThere are other cases like International College of Surgeons and Rosado\nthat, again, emphasize that this is a discretionary question. And I don't\nthink this Court should just depart from all of that precedent here.\nI don't think there's a good reason to.\nAnd this Court should --this is a statutory question. Stare decisis carries\nenhanced force in the statutory context, and that's why we've asked the\nCourt to continue to apply settled law.\n### Justice Kavanaugh:\nThank you.",

      "dialogue": "Justice Jackson\n### Justice Jackson:\n?\nJust a couple of quick points.\nSo you keep talking about protecting the defendant's prerogative of\nremoval.\nBut I thought there was also sort of basic principles about the plaintiff's\nprerogative to bring a case in state or federal court to be the master of\ntheir claims.\nAnd so what I don't understand is why the plaintiff has to be stuck with\nthe jurisdictional consequences of claims they are no longer bringing?\nThey've given up their ability to seek relief on the federal claims, and so\nit just seems odd to me, especially when our case law kind of generally\nlinks jurisdiction with the claim, you have to have jurisdiction for every\nclaim, those two concepts run together, and yet somehow they can drop\nclaims and still be, in your view, subject to the jurisdictional\nconsequences of that.\nThat just seems discordant to me, so can you speak a little bit about\nthat?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nIt's a really important question, Your Honor, because what Congress was\ntrying to do is take into account the right of plaintiffs to be the master of\ntheir complaint but also the right of defendants to remove.\n### Justice Jackson:\nBut Justice Gorsuch points to statutes that talk about remand.\nSo, even though the defendant has exercised its right of removal, there\nare circumstances in which that right is not given precedence.\nThe case goes back to state court, right?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nThat's exactly right. It's up to the district court to decide.\nAnd we think in the mine run of cases where you amend the complaint\nright after you remove, there's removal to federal court, that's going to\ngo back to state court.\nWhat we're really talking about here are more unusual cases where it's\nbeen going on for a long time.\n### Justice Jackson:\nCan I just ask you about the text, moving quickly because I'm mindful of\nthe time.\nI don't understand how the question could possibly be whether or not\nthere is original jurisdiction at the time of removal. Of course, there is.\nThat's why the case gets to be removed.\nI mean, there's no question there that does any work because you only\nget to remove it if there's original jurisdiction.\nSo isn't the question really what happens when, after we've identified\noriginal jurisdiction and it's removed, the claims over which there were\noriginal jurisdiction drop out? Can supplemental jurisdiction be\nexercised when those original jurisdiction claims are no longer there?\nWhen we look at the text of 1367, I don't understand your argument\nthat supplemental jurisdiction arises in that situation because (a) says,\nin any civil action of which district courts have original jurisdiction, the\ndistrict court shall have supplemental jurisdiction.\nBut, in my scenario, original jurisdiction is gone.\nSo how can you have supplemental jurisdiction in a situation like this?\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nI think it's really important to go back to the first principles that this\nCourt was applying in Cohill.\nIt was looking at St. P aul Mercury, which holds that you have original\njurisdiction at a particular time.\nAnd so, once you get original jurisdiction, you continue to have\nsupplemental jurisdiction.\nThat's what the Court held in Rosado.\n### Justice Jackson:\nor ever had original jurisdiction? It seems to be in the present tense\nsaying that you have to have original jurisdiction in order to exercise\nsupplemental.\n### Katherine B. Wellington:\nAnd I think that's because you have decades and decades of precedent\nsaying that in a removal context, you look at whether there's\njurisdiction at the time of removal.\nAt that time, the district court has original jurisdiction, and then the\nquestion is, will it continue to have supplemental jurisdiction? The text\nhere is framed in a forward-looking future tense, and we think \"shall\nhave\" does cover the situation where there's ongoing supplemental\njurisdiction.\n### Justice Jackson:\nThank you.",

But Cohill's logic does cut against you, I think, fairly heavily here\nbecause, as I read, Cohill what it does is say something like this: You\nknow, the supplemental jurisdiction business, ever since Gibbs, we've\nunderstood it as a completely discretionary area of jurisdiction.\nYou can keep the case.\nYou can dismiss the case.\nIf you can keep the case and you can dismiss the case, surely you should\nbe able to remand the case as well.\nAnd that's the essential logic of Cohill.\nIt's like everything is discretionary in this area, why shouldn't this be\ntoo?

So, instead of an approach that\ngives district courts discretion in every case to determine what makes\nsense as a matter of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and\ncomity, they want an inflexible rule that gives district courts no choi ce\nand that would subject the defendant's right to removal to the\nplaintiff's caprice.\nAs the Chief's questions suggest, where this Court decides to overrule\nevery single court of appeals, it should have a really good reason.\nAnd there isn't a really good reason here to upset a longstanding\njurisdictional rule that has worked just fine for a century.\nThe Eighth Circuit simply got it wrong, and this Court should vacate the\ndecision below.\nThank you.\n\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nThank you.
