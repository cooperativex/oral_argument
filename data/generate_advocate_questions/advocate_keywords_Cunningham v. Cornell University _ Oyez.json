  "background": "Chief Justice Roberts\n### Chief Justice Roberts:\nWe'll hear argument next in Case 23-1007, Cunningham versus Cornell\nUniversity.\nMr. Wang.\n### Xiao Wang:\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted\nERISA, it identified a number of prohibited transactions and codified\nthat understanding in 29 U.S.C. Section 1106.\nIn Congress's view, these transactions posed a special risk of being\npotentially harmful to the plan, generally because they involved a party\nin interest, which includes a fiduciary's relative or an officer or an owner\nof the plan or a person providing services to the plan.\nPetitioners here have identified a transaction that falls within the text\nof Section 1106, and the Second Circuit's decision to dismiss that claim\nprior to discovery was incorrect for three reasons. First, text and\nstructure.\nCongress frequently writes laws where it puts liability in one part of the\nstatute and exceptions to liability in another, and when it does so, this\nCourt has time and again held that plaintiffs plead and prove liability\nand defendants plead and prove exceptions to liability.\nSecond, precedent.\nIn Keystone Consolidated and Harris Trust, this Court made clear that\nthe prohibited transaction provisions provide for categorical rules.\nBut what the Second Circuit's approach does is it conver ts those\ncategorical rules into qualified ones.\nAnd that brings me to the final reason for reversal, which is that they're\nnot just qualified prohibitions, but they're qualified based on\nexemptions that involve information that plaintiffs cannot know and do\nnot know prior to discovery, information like who the counterparties are\nin a cross-trade or how large a block trade is or what asset classes are in\na block trade, which is exactly why, when Congress wrote these\nprovisions, it intended for petitioners to plead and prove under Section\n1106 and for defendants to plead and prove under Section 1108.\nFor these reasons, Your Honor, we ask this Court to reverse the\njudgment of the Second Circuit.\nI welcome the Court's questions.",

Everyone has them.\nYou have to have them.\nSo it's --it's an automatic ticket, pass go, go immediately to discovery,\nsummary judgment, huge expense.\nThese universities, other defendants are saying that's just completely\nabsurd and ridiculous, which is -- you know, the starting point of Judge\nLivingston's analysis was -- was looking at trying to make sense of all\nthis in context, I think.

A district court could say, after the answer\nis filed, I want a reply, and then rule on whether it can be determined\nbased on the pleadings if the defendant is entitled to judgment on the\npleadings?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCertainly, Your Honor.\nI think that's how we would see it.\nOf course, a district court could have other options available to it, such\nas limited discovery or an expedited summary judgment motion, as\nwell.\n### Justice Alito:\nDo you think that that's -- that should be mandatory for the district\ncourt to go through that -- well, I'll ask the Solicitor General that.\nI have no more questions.\nThank you.",

I'm not quite sure still, and I will ask the\ngovernment this, under normal pleading standards, I would have\nthought this was enough.\nI think that the Second Circuit was thinking that it has to be pled with\nTwombly and Iqbal as a fraud and that you needed more particularized\ninformation relating to the nature of the services in total, some\ninformation that you say you couldn't have known.\n### Xiao Wang:\nYes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nYou just knew how much was being paid and you compared it to what\nother people were paying.\n### Xiao Wang:\nComparable plans, yes.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nExactly.\nSo, if I have a problem with that part of it, that the Second Circuit may\nhave asked for more than you needed to plead, what do I do?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nEven if I accepted their proposition that you need to allege for whatever\nreason a pleading standard, injury standard, that you have to allege\nsomething more than that they have a transaction, do I get to address\nthat or I don't, or what am I doing here?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCertainly, Justice Sotomayor.\nI think that what you're doing here is -- is, first, I think you would\nreverse. We -- we would ask this Court to reverse the judgment of the\nSecond Circuit.\nAnd it would reverse by saying, look, you --if these are enough under\nIqbal and Twombly and it involves unreasonableness, then whatever\nrule you apply, we would still say that there was a legal error here. But, if\nI can get back to what I think may be the first part of your question,\nwhich is perhaps the relative weakness of our --of our decision about\nthe \"except as otherwise provided\" language at the top, well, first, I\nthink that precedent answers this point, and precedent answers this\npoint in a couple different ways.\nOne is Respondents have provided no cases where that actually changes\nthe calculus. It turns except -- the words \"except as otherwise\nprovided\" magically turns the word -- the exempt -- exemptions into\nelements.\nThere's no case on that point.\nIn fact, the cases like Atlantic Richfield and Schlemmer make fairly clear\nthat all that's doing is saying w hat happens when things clash.\nIt doesn't expand or contract the liability provisions at all.\nAnd I think, sort of maybe as a concluding point on this point, that is\nreinforced by the structure and the complexity and the nuance that's\nprovided in 1108 that involves an information asymmetry that -- that,\nagain, cannot be addressed prior to discovery.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nI'm going to ask the other two about the Second Circuit factual ruling,\nwhich was that with respect to this provision, you have the burden of\nshowing unreasonableness, but it reserved consideration of whether\nthere were other exemptions that you didn't bear the burden about\nproving.\nI don't know how it got there at all.\n### Xiao Wang:\nRight.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nAnd I'll ask the government and your adversary how we do that. But\nCook did say that -- established a narrow ruling for criminal pleadings.\nI don't think there's any case that ever has applied it to civil\nexemptions, correct?\n### Xiao Wang:\nCorrect.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nSo it's hard to rely on Cook, but the essence of its thinking was, if a\nprohibition looks like -- if a prohibition looks like it's -- you can't really\ntell it's illegal or not because the exemption here says you can have\nthese relationships, you can just have them with reasonable fees, then\nyou need for the -- for the government -- for the government to prove\nthey were unreasonable.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nWhy wouldn't that apply here, that concept?\n### Xiao Wang:\nWhy wouldn't Cook's apply here?\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nObservation.\n### Xiao Wang:\nYeah.\nI -- I --I think it wouldn't apply not simply just because of the\ncriminal/civil distinction that we talked a bout but also for the\ninformation asymmetries that you mention.\nAnd it doesn't sort of -- really, I think the Respondents are asking this\nCourt to sort of carve out the statute in a few different ways, to --to try\nto gerrymander it by saying: Look, we'll put the (b)(2) exemption, we'll\ntreat that as an element and we'll try to carve out service providers, and\nthen we'll stitch together 1106 and 1108.\nBut that's not how the statute is written.\nAnd, certainly, that might lead to some results.\nWe don't see that happening in the Eighth or Ninth Circuits, but, if it\ndoes, I think that's in Congress's province to address.\n### Justice Sotomayor:\nThank you.",
